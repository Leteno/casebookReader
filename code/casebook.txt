Editor¡¯s Note 
Welcome students: 
The Duke MBA Consulting Club (DMCC) is proud to present the 2016-2017 DMCC Casebook. This year we have included 
over 20 brand new cases and ¡°greatest hits¡± section featuring some of the most acclaimed cases from previous Fuqua 
casebooks. The objective of this book is to help you prepare for your upcoming consulting case interviews. Case 
interviews are an integral part of the hiring process for consulting firms. These interviews give you the opportunity to 
showcase your communication, client, creative and analytical skills to your interviewer. This book was developed to 
complement the Duke MBA Consulting Roadmap curriculum. We hope that using both will help lead you to success during 
the upcoming recruiting season. 
Included are industry one pagers to give you an overview of each industry. Although we cannot prepare you for everything 
you might encounter during your case interviews we went to great lengths to diversify the case content. Current cases 
cover a wide variety of topics from healthcare to travel, across several problem types. Finally, we have included a 
resource page and feedback form to help you prepare and help us improve the casebook. 
This casebook could not have been completed without all of the wonderful cases submitted by your classmates. We 
would also like to thank our friends at other MBA programs for sharing with us their old casebooks to supplement the 
cases herein. 
We wish you luck with your preparation and would like you to remember that your fellow DMCC members are here to 
help! Please reach out to anyone on the cabinet if you feel that you are not ¡°cracking the case¡±. Lastly, to the students of 
other top MBA programs using this casebook during their preparation, we warmly welcome you to ¡°Team Fuqua.¡± 
Good luck!

Casebook Overview 
. The first section provides key industry one pagers followed by a case table of 
contents and practice cases 
. Qualitative and quantitative case difficulty is identified within the case table of 
contents; difficulty is rated as easy, medium and difficult. Medium is considered to be 
at the level of a typical interview case. 
. Ask the behavioral questions EVERY TIME you give a case! 
. Most cases are adaptable, so try to familiarize yourself with the case prior to giving it 
. Print exhibits before giving the case or be prepared to share digitally (we tried to 
ensure that all exhibits are effective when printed in black and white, but recommend 
double checking your print outs to be sure!) 
. HAVE FUN!

Price competition from generic drug manufacturers. Increasing pressure from health insurance companies and 
hospitals to reduce prices. R&D challenge of finding high revenue drugs (¡®Blockbusters¡¯ have annual sales > $1B). 
Weaker investments in R&D in recent years. Loss of patent on key drugs for many large pharma companies, 
especially for specialty biologic drugs in the next 5 years. 
Key trends 
Customers Doctors who prescribe these medicines 
Insurance companies that pay for them (i.e. private insurers, Medicare (over 65), Medicaid (low-income/disabled) 
Patients/consumers who need these drugs/medicines 
In some emerging markets officials (provincial and central government) may control channel access 
Over the counter (¡°OTC¡±, can be sold without prescription); Retail outlets ¨C CVS, Walgreens; Mail order/online; 
hospitals; pharmacies; doctor¡¯s offices; B2B: Distributors/intermediaries Distribution 
channel(s) 
Size of specific treatment area / level of competition; Buy-in from doctors that will prescribe; Speed to market (1st to 
market is important)/ expertise in difficult products (for generics). Dosage and frequency of drugs can alter revenue. 
Revenue can come directly from patients, but most is received from third party insurers) 
Revenue 
Brand name/originator drug manufacturers produce original patent-protected (for a certain period of time) drugs for 
human and animal diseases. Generic drug producers produce ¡®copy-cat¡¯ drugs (with the same medical result) at a 
lower development cost when the originator drug¡¯s patent expires. 
Success contingent on drug effectiveness, adoption/buy-in from doctors, coverage approval from private and public 
insurers, patient adherence and ease of use. Products compete within various treatment areas (T): cancer, 
cardiovascular, psychology etc. US, Europe and Japan are largest markets although emerging market opportunity 
(eg. China, India, Brazil) is growing. In the US, the Food & Drug Authority (FDA) needs to approve all drugs before 
sale. Generic drugs are treated as substitutes and usually receive more favorable reimbursements by insurers.

. Tell me about a time when you had a disagreement with a colleague in which you 
didn¡¯t find an amicable outcome. How did you manage your relationship with this 
colleague going forward? 
. What aspects of a job do you find most rewarding? Why? 
Question 1: 
Question 2:

YachtCo 
22 
. Your client is YachtCo, a US-based luxury motor yacht manufacturer. Started in 
1958, they have grown into one of the largest and most prestigious yacht brands in 
the country. However, they have seen a gradual decline in their profitability in recent 
years. Their CEO has come to you to develop a turnaround strategy for the company, 
aiming to improve profitability for the medium-to-long term. 
Prompt #1: 
. YachtCo has 2 core lines of business: (1) design and sale of new boats, (2) maintenance and/or 
renovation of existing boats. 
. Their main buyers are high net worth individuals and companies, both domestic and abroad. 
. Competitors: Stable revenues with slight decline in profits, but not to the same degree as 
YachtCo. 
. Customers: market research shows that YachtCo is still maintaining its market share in the luxury 
yacht segment, despite competition from abroad. 
. Rev/Cost/Profit: If asked about finances, say that you will return to this later and ask them to 
complete the framework 
Interviewer Guidance (Provide only upon request): 
¿ìÍ§

YachtCo 
23 
Provide the interviewee with the following information: 
. New Yacht Sales 
¨C 2014: 100 sales, average sale price $3.2M, average cost $2.6M 
¨C 2015: 110 sales, average sale price $3.3M, average cost $3.0M 
. Yacht Repair/ Renovations 
¨C 2014: 200 contracts, average contract $850K, average cost $710K 
¨C 2015: 300 contracts, average contract $900K, average cost $750K 
Prompt #2: 
A good candidate will note that profits from new yacht sales have declined, largely due to the 
increased average costs. They will also note that yacht repairs/ renovations have seen profit growth, 
however not enough to offset the decline from new yacht sales. 
Ask candidate for possible reasons as to why profitability has declined in new yacht sales 
. Costs have increased: design, raw materials, transport, labor 
. Competitor price pressures restrict increase in sale price 
Once candidate identifies that increased costs are eroding profits, provide candidate with 
next prompt.

Given the increased demand for steel in Asia and the Middle East, the price of highgrade 
steel has jumped over 50% in the past year from $1100 to $1800 per metric ton. 
Give candidate Exhibit 1. 
YachtCo¡¯s engineering department recommended that YachtCo transition from 
traditional steel hulls to newer fiberglass hulls to reduce the costs of construction. Is it 
worth doing this over the next 5 years? 
Prompt #3: 
The idea here is to get the candidate to calculate the estimated costs associated with each method 
(stay with steel or transition to fiberglass). 
If asked: 
- Number of new yachts expected to remain at 100/year over the next 5 years 
- Average quantity of steel needed per yacht: 30 tons 
- Predicted cost of steel: Stable at $1800/ton 
- Assume no downtime in transition to fiberglass hulls 
- Assume that labor costs are the same for both hull types 
- Do NOT need to discount cash flows for the purpose of this calculation 
Interviewer Guidance: 

YachtCo: Exhibit 1 
. Steel prices: 
. Steel price: $1800/ton 
. Average requirements per yacht: 30 tons 
. Estimated new yachts: 100 per year for 5 years 
. Equipment and employee training for new fiberglass hulls: $4 million (one-time expense) 
. Estimated construction cost per boat: $40,000 
. Assumptions: Assume no shipyard downtime during transition 
Option 1: Continue with current steel hull design 
Option 2: Transition to fiberglass hulls

The idea here is to get the candidate to 
calculate the estimated costs associated 
with each method (stay with steel or 
transition to fiberglass). 
If asked: 
- Number of new yachts expected to 
remain at 100 per year over the next 5 
years 
- Average quantity of steel needed per

- Predicted cost of steel: Stable at 
$1800/ton 
Candidate may identify several other 
financial factors to consider: depreciation of 
new equipment, labor costs, etc. 
. Calculations for Option 1: 
¨C 30 tons/boat * $1800/ton = $54,000/boat 
¨C $54,000* 100 boats * 5 years = $27M 
. Calculation for Option 2: 
¨C $40,000 boat *100 boats * 5 years = $20M 
¨C $20M + $4M up-front cost = $24M 
. Based on these calculations, it is ideal to 
go with option 2

Exhibit #1 Guidance: Analysis:

YachtCo 
27 
Given your recommendation of _________, what other factors should you YachtCo 
consider when changing hull types? 
Feel free to take a minute to organize your thoughts before presenting 
Prompt #4: 
The key here is to approach this in a systematic method. If the candidate just starts listing things off, 
ask them to bucket them (if using the case as a teaching exercise rather than a full practice case). 
One such method is below: 
1) Customer: customer preferences and willingness to pay for different hull type (i.e. is any one 
type superior?), versatility in design and construction, down-time for yacht construction and 
potential complications associated with this 
2) Company: cost of transition, repair and maintenance of boats (will this new hull type reduce the 
need for maintenance, thereby reducing other profit streams), ongoing training requirements, 
fluctuations in steel costs over time, depreciation opportunities for equipment, brand reputation, 
etc. 
3) Competitors: What is the market standard? Is there a shift towards fiberglass, or possibly even 
a new material? 
4) A strong candidate will identify that the rising cost of steel does not account for the entire 
increase in YachtCo¡¯s costs. If the candidate addresses this, inform them that their firm is 
addressing other costs in a different workstream. 
Interviewer Guidance: 

YachtCo

. The CEO has asked you to summarize your findings and present them to the board. 
Please make your recommendation 
Recommendation 
. Candidate should summarize several key findings here: 
¨C Identify the unit (new construction) that is adversely affecting company profitability 
¨C Recognize that the rise in steel prices is driving construction costs up 
¨C Note that swapping to fiberglass hulls will be more profitable over five years 
. Outstanding candidates may also explore: 
¨C Outsource hull construction to 3rd party to keep costs down 
¨C Look into ways to reduce cost of steel: bulk buying, recycle hulls from old boats, etc 
. Candidate should recognize that switching to fiberglass hulls will not provide 
adequate savings to offset drop in revenue. This is one of the key learning points of 
the case: the recommendation needs to achieve the CEO objective from Prompt 1.

Question 2:

Dam It 
31 
. California is dealing with very harsh drought conditions. It is economically impacting the lives and 
businesses of its residents. The state financial committee has been presented with a project to 
capture more water by increasing the size of a current dam, especially given the constraints on 
their budget and a set of competing state projects in other domains. Currently, California is buying 
water from Nevada. Though the new project seems promising, the committee wants to ensure 
the investment is sound. Can you help the state of California evaluate this proposal? 
Prompt #1: 
. The water purchased from Nevada is used across the state to fulfill all needs including wineries 
and residential use 
. There is only one other project for which the state is considering funding with this allocated money 
. The second project is an additional wing to the state hospital to be built from the ground up 
. The second project is just as socially important as the dam 
. Framework should include (a MECE framework will have Financial, Social & political/other 
alternatives): 
¨C Candidate should draw on Finance knowledge to compare projects (NPV, IRR, Comps, Multiples) 
¨C Should include Costs and Revenues as this case is centered around profitability for the state at the core 
¨C Other buckets can include macroeconomic issues, regulatory issues, voting/citizen rights issues etc. 
Interviewer Guidance:

If candidate does not drive to NPV: 
The state would like to find out the current value to compare projects equally. 
Prompt #2: 
. This is a question of a growing perpetuity. The candidate should realize that they 
need the investment¡¯s cost and revenue information. 
Interviewer Guidance:

Interviewer guidance on NPV 
. Initial Investment = 15M 
. Yearly Revenues from things like power generation = 
1.5M/yr 
. Yearly Cost of supplies and Upkeep = 250K 
. Yearly SG&A = 750k 
. All taxes can be ignored 
. Cost of purchasing water from Nevada = 100K 
. Candidate should request discount rate and growth rate 
¨C Discount Rate = 5% 
¨C Growth Rate = 3% 
. Candidate should use perpetuity formula (...... 
.....) 
. Total Revenue = 1.5M + 100K 
. ...... = .............. . ........ .... ................ + ....&.. = 1.6M ¨C (250K +

. Candidate should drive towards comparing this project to project 2 and request 
information to attain the NPV of that project. 
. NPV of Project 2 ( A new hospital) = 15.1M 
The likely outcome is that from a financial standpoint project 2 is the most attractive but 
only slightly. 
Interviewer Guidance:

Dam It 
35 
. What non-financial factors should we consider when deciding between these two projects? 
Prompt #3: 
. This is a structured brainstorming exercise 
. Examples can include: ability to generate more revenue channels from another project like 
hospital (research etc), building a project from ground up compared to adding on to a project (the 
dam) for only a 100K difference may not make sense, considering the most critical social and 
political issues is equally important.

Question 2:

Sam¡¯s Sushi 
39 
. You are out to dinner with a colleague at Sam¡¯s Sushi, a Michelin-starred sushi restaurant in Wichita, 
Kansas. Sam¡¯s rose to prominence due to it¡¯s unerring commitment to both quality and simplicity (Sam 
prides himself on only serving two items: sushi and sake). After a few sushi rolls and more glasses of 
sake than you care to count, your colleague asks you how much you think the restaurant is worth and 
whether or not buying it would be a good investment. 
. How would you go about determining the value of the restaurant? 
Prompt #1: 
. Candidate should use a revenue ¨C cost framework to determine cash flows. The value of the restaurant is 
the present value of the future cash flows. 
. Once candidate has demonstrated that they want to use a revenue ¨C cost framework, prompt them to 
provide detail about what the revenue and cost buckets consist of: 
¨C For revenues, bucket consists of the number of items (sushi + sake) ordered and their respective 
prices 
¨C For costs, there are two components: fixed and variable 
. Possible fixed costs: rent, maintenance, insurance, labor, license fees, etc. 
. Variable costs: COGS (rice, fish, soy sauce, wasabi, sake)

16.667% is 1/6 
$4,800 * 1/6 * 4 days (Sam¡¯s is closed on

. Now let¡¯s think about Sam¡¯s cash flows. We have the following information about their cost structure and growth rates: 
¨C Staff: A hostess, a waiter, and a sushi chef. All 3 work the entire evening. 
¨C Tax rate: 40% 
¨C Discount rate: 13% 
¨C Annual growth rate of cash flows: 3% 
¨C Variable costs: 20% of total revenue 
¨C Fixed costs: $120,000/year 
. What are the annual cash flows? 
. What is the value of the restaurant? 
Prompt #3: 
. Revenues = $568,000 
. Costs = $120,000 + (0.2 * $568,000) = $233,600 
. Revenues ¨C Costs = $334,400 
. To determine net present value, we need the after tax cash flow number 
¨C $334,400 * (1-40%) = $200,400 
. Candidate should use the perpetuity formula to perform the valuation. 
¨C Cash Flows / (Discount Rate ¨C Growth Rate) 
¨C $200,400 / (.13 - .03) = ~$2M 
Interviewer Guidance:

Sam¡¯s Sushi 
44 
. So, your colleague needs an answer. What do you tell them about the profitability 
and valuation of the restaurant? Is it a good investment? 
Recommendation 
. Candidate should state the restaurant has $200K annual cash flow and is worth $2M 
based on the previous valuation exercise. 
. $2M is a lot for a single restaurant in a small market, and appears to have healthy 
annual cash flow and low overhead, thus making it a solid investment. 
. Extra points if candidate also considers strategic angles (restaurant must have 
significant competitive advantage to be doing so well in such a small market with 
limited access to fish, is most likely sole high-end sushi restaurant in the greater 
Wichita area, etc.) to further bolster investment rationale.

Now that we have focused on the US and UAE, let¡¯s explore production and shipping 
costs of each geography. 
Hot Koala works with a manufacturer in China for its other product lines and would like 
to continue partnering with this manufacturer for the PBPF. The manufacturer handles 
production and can handle shipping to the UAE, but previous research has shown that 
it would be price prohibitive to use the manufacturer to ship directly to customers in the 
US. As a result, bundles of PBPFs would have to be shipped to a US entity that would 
handle storage and fulfillment of orders for a fee. 
What are some potential cost drivers? 
Prompt #2: 
Run through a quick brainstorming of the potential cost drivers in this situation that 
includes cost of production, overhead, transportation etc. 
From there, present Exhibit 2.

Prompt #3: 
¨C US Revenue: 
. 50,000 * $50 * 1.1 = $2,750,000 
¨C US Market Share:

74 
Make a recommendation as to where Hot Koala should attempt to commercialize its 
PBPF. 
Recommendation 
Look for structured logic and justifications that pull in all the points from the case. He or 
she should take into account market size, growth rate, breakeven prices, existing 
presence, and average pricing. 
A good candidate will notice that costs are at par with the average selling price in the 
US markets and hence, even a 10% margin does not sound attainable, unless the new 
product is highly differentiated. The approach should be to enter the US market through 
an alternate strategy and continue to double-down on UAE since the client¡¯s market 
share is still low, the average selling prices are high, and there is scope for 
consolidation

Exhibit #3 ¨C Sardine Maintenance 
83 
TO: Penny McPincher, CEO of Sardine Airlines 
FROM: Michael Huerta, Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration 
DATE: June 30th, 2015 
SUBJECT: Sardine Airlines Maintenance Record 
This memorandum is to notify that as of today, Sardine Airlines is no longer 
under maintenance supervision from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). 
The FAA believes the improved maintenance program no longer warrants FAA 
intervention. 
Any future decrease in maintenance standards will result in FAA supervision or 
sanctions.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit 3 
. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 
is the U.S. Government regulatory agency 
responsible for the safety of U.S. airlines 
. The candidate should put together that 
the increase in maintenance spending is 
directly tied to the fact that previous 
maintenance spending was not sufficient 
to be considered safe 
. The candidate should move off of 
maintenance cost cutting 
. If the candidate still is interested in 
pursuing cost cutting in maintenance give 
them this prompt, ¡°Our client is adamant 
that the recently improved maintenance 
program is running at peak efficiency and 
any cuts would invite unwanted scrutiny 
from regulators.¡± 
84 
Exhibit #1 Guidance: Analysis:

Sardine Airlines 
85 
. Sardine Airlines has been aggressively advertising to combat competitive pressures. 
Both the CEO and the Board believe this is a critical expenditure. Recently the 
landlord for the firm¡¯s headquarters in Oakland raised rent by $35M. Customer 
service complaints have increased nearly 3,000%, which the company believes is 
due to the new 12 inch seats that were installed in the entire fleet. This has caused 
Sardine¡¯s call center provider to increase billing by 520% from 2014¡¯s $12.36M. What 
can Sardine Airlines do to address these issues? 
Prompt #2: 
. Neither the CEO or Board will take any recommendations on cutting the marketing 
expenses 
. The firm does not have to be headquartered in Oakland, but does want to be in a 
location where it has major operations 
. The firm is not interested in increasing seat sizes. They are actually looking to pilot 8 
inch seats in a new class of service called, ¡°steerage¡± 
. The call center vendor charges rates that are on average 60% higher because their 
call center¡¯s are based in the United States and staffed with native English speakers 
. Rent in Tulsa or Hartford would be 40% less than current 2015 rent (INTERVIEWER 
GUIDANCE this equates to $34.4M) 
Interviewer Guidance:

Sardine Airlines 
86 
. The CEO, Ms. McPincher is going to be joining us in just a few minutes to hear your 
recommendations on how to improve profitability. 
Recommendation 
. Candidate should have a recommendation that includes the following: 
¨C To increase profit margin to 20%, Sardine Airlines should focus on cutting SG&A 
costs 
¨C There are two key ways to cut SG&A, customer service and rent 
¨C Recommend that the call center vendor should transition to an overseas based 
vendor, which would save approximately $38M 
¨C Move the headquarters to either Tulsa or Hartford, which will have less expensive 
office real estate markets and thus find major cost savings 
¨C Given the relative low increase in revenue from installing 12¡± inch seats, 
recommend against 8¡± seats 
. Risks should include: one-time expenses in moving the headquarters, unhappy 
customers from decreased customer service quality

Question 2:

The Run of the Mill NOWOCO 
89 
Our client is a Germany-based, material manufacturer called ¡®The Run of the Mill NOWOCO¡¯ 
specializing in a range of products for the construction industry. In recent months, our client has 
benefited from anti-dumping taxes on the import of similar products. This has resulted in a 
demand surge for our client and other domestic competitors; however overall profitability is 
going down and customer complaints about order fulfilment are at an all-time high. As an 
integral part of your team, what do you think is going on here? 
Prompt #1: 
. The ultimate goals are to maximize overall profitability & order fulfilment % for key customers. 
¨C Key customers will be the ones contributing the most to profitability. 
. The client sells products (specific product lines are irrelevant for this case) for the construction industry. It 
sells directly to customers & through distributors in Germany only. 
. The client is one of the 3 largest domestic producers with almost 30% market share 
. The client defines: 
¨C Profitability over variable costs, that is, profitability = R ¨C VC 
¨C Order fulfilment % is defined as: (% of tons delivered on time / total tons ordered) 
. Framework that captures: 
¨C Financial aspects (revenues, variable costs) to address profitability 
¨C Operational issues (manufacturing issues, utilization, logistics, issues in downstream/upstream) to 
address customer complaint issues 
¨C External factors (geography, competitors, macroeconomic factors) 
Interviewer Guidance (provide only if asked):

. What are some ways the client can increase the order fulfillment as defined previously? 
. What are some of the trade-offs of doing that? 
Prompt #2: 
. Relying on the framework created in the initial prompt, the interviewee should brainstorm to 
create a new structure/buckets that should touch upon the following points: 
¨C Reduce process time, transportation time, and/or other lead times 
¨C Increase inventory levels 
¨C More accurate forecasting 
¨C Improve supplier engagements and distribution / transportation planning 
. Challenges/Trade-offs: 
¨C Increased inventory will imply higher working capital and inventory cost 
¨C Will put additional pressure on manufacturing 
¨C Reducing lead times may compromise on the robustness of the current process/may not 
be feasible 
. Push the discussion towards increasing inventory levels by ramping up production 
Interviewer Guidance:

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
. Present Exhibit 1 to the candidate after the discussion on increasing inventory levels by 
ramping up production. 
. From the exhibit, the candidate should be able to observe that: 
¨C The client has 3 manufacturing locations 
¨C The total utilization is 100% (that is, the plants are running at full capacity) 
¨C That the total available time for production is split into production time and scheduled and 
unscheduled maintenance. 
. Since the units are all constrained (that is, they are running at full capacity), we need to focus 
on reallocating volumes to the most profitable customers (profitable in terms of 
Profitability/Hour). 
Background 
. Production ratio is the ratio of the total time available when the production happened 
. Schedule loss ratio is the ratio of time lost due to scheduled maintenance 
. Unscheduled loss ratio is the time that is lost as a result of unanticipated breakdowns 
and quality issues 
. Though the actual production is only about 80% of the total time, it is consistent with the 
industry standard and the scope for improvement may be minimal 
. Products are similar, and hence the cost structures are not too different (take a customer 
approach)

. How can the client prioritize customers and improve the order fulfillment? 
. What information will be required to make this decision? 
Prompt #3: 
. The client can prioritize based on how profitable (over variable cost) the different 
customers are and then reallocate production to these customers 
. The information required will be: 
¨C Revenues 
¨C Costs 
¨C Volumes ordered 
¨C Volume fulfilled for different customers. 
. After this discussion, handover Exhibit 2 to the interviewee

. Based on Exhibit 2, calculate the best case profitability and order fulfilment % for the 
customers assuming no demand constraints 
Prompt #4: 
. The candidate should make initial observations about how fulfillment for orders for high-value 
customers are low and there needs to be a re-allocation of volumes for these prioritized 
customers 
. When asked for clarification, explain that: 
¨C Revenues are the total revenues 
¨C Volumes Ordered is the total quantity ordered by the customer 
¨C Order fulfilment % is defined as the tons of orders fulfilled/total number of tons as a % for 
a customer 
. Guide the interviewee to calculate the current profitability and reallocate volumes to the most 
important customers based on the highest profitability per ton. 
Interviewer Guidance:

Exhibit #2 (Interviewer Guidance 1 of 2) 
. The candidate could set up a table as shown below 
1. Volume Fulfilled = Volume Ordered * Order Fulfilment % 
2. Profitability / Ton = (Revenue/Volume Fulfilled) ¨C Variable cost per ton = 
(Revenue/Volume Fulfilled) ¨C 1250 
3. Total Profitability = Profitability/Ton * Volume fulfilled

Exhibit #2 (Interviewer Guidance 2 of 2) 
. The candidate calculates a best case scenario to maximize profits and order fulfilment for 
all customers by reallocating volumes to the key customers F, B, and G 
. In this case, the order fulfillment for F, B, and G will be 100% (60, 45, & 20 kt respectively), 
and the residual capacity of 2 tons will go to C. 
¨C The total capacity of 127 kt is a constant. 
. This increases overall profits from 212 M to 326 M (an increase of 54%) and an order 
fulfillment of the top 3 customers of 100% 
. A good candidate will also talk about the potential risks with this strategy (go to prompt #5)

. What are the risks of suggesting this strategy to focus on the top 3 customers only? 
. What are some of the ways these risks could be mitigated? 
Prompt #5: 
. The answer should be bucketed (e.g., risks can be bucketed into risk involving de-prioritized customers and 
risks associated with the currently defined key customers) 
. Risks: 
¨C Future potential and growth of some of the currently less-preferred customers 
¨C Volatility of the prioritized key customers 
¨C Risk arising out of less customer diversification 
¨C Customers served only 20% will likely migrate to another supplier 
. Mitigation: 
¨C Fulfillment of 100% may not be necessary ¨C identify customers¡¯ expectations and match those 
¨C New production - outsourcing or set-up 
¨C Increase the lead time requirement in the contract 
¨C Reduce orders 
¨C Prioritize the most crucial parts and deliver them 
¨C Have different supply chains for different products.

You walked into an elevator with the CEO. What would your final recommendation be? 
Recommendation 
. Recommend undertaking a prioritization exercise & reallocation of volumes to the most profitable 
customers that would increase profits by 54%. 
. The prioritized customers at this time will be defined as the ¡°Big 3¡± (F,B & G), which will have 
100% order fulfillment. The other customers will not be served or served minimally after demand 
for F,B & G is met adequately. 
. Risks and mitigations were discussed in the previous prompt and can be quickly summarized 
. There should be careful and sensitive communication with the sales team and all customers (esp. 
ones that are deprioritized) 
. There should be a weekly process arrangement to implement and coordinate this 
recommendation & measure the results

Question 1: 
Question 2:

Your client, Critical Transportation (CT), provides logistical support for the rail industry on the West 
Coast of the United States. Due to the recent Panama Canal expansion, CT is expecting a shift in rail 
volume to the East Coast once the expanded canal opens in early 2016. CT has retained our firm¡¯s 
services to determine if it should make the investment to expand its business to the East Coast. 
. Background information if the interviewee asks: 
. Objective: CT wants to determine if their current business model would be profitable on the East 
Coast; and whether entry into this market makes sense given the shifts in the market. 
. Current Market: Currently, CT is a market leader with 25% market share; there are 5 competitors in the 
West Coast market and the total market size is $2B 
. Business Model: CT provides rail transportation services from major port locations on West Coast to 
distribution centers all over the Western U.S. Once cargo is loaded (completed by port personnel), they 
transport via rail to a final location where it is unloaded by their client. CT does not provide any 
additional services. 
. Trends: It is estimated that 25% of West Coast container traffic will shift to the East Coast beginning in 
2016. Over time, the West and East Coast ports are expected to equalize in revenue earned per year. 
. Possible Market: There are only 3 other comparable companies on the East Coast that focus on CT¡¯s 
core competency, and these companies have no West Coast presence. 
. Costs: CT estimates that entry into the East Coast market will cost a minimum of $450M, but once 
entered, East Coast operations will cost approximately the same as West Coast operations.

. This case is meant to be driven by interviewee, allow him/her to drive the case after each 
prompt and respond with ¡°ands¡± if depth of explanation does not make path forward clear. 
. Most candidates will recognize that this is a profitability case. A good candidate will see 
aspects of market entry and tailor their problem solving accordingly. Additionally, he or she will 
focus not only on current business model but additional value add activities. 
. Interviewee should develop a MECE framework. Some example buckets are: 
. External: market factors, customer demand, regulatory concerns 
. Revenue: pricing strategy, volume, service offerings 
. Costs: ID variable and fixed cost, benchmarking competitors 
. Market: Competition, market share, barriers to entry 
. Entry: acquisition, JV, build from ground up 
. Drive the interviewee to think outside of the box in terms of product offerings. CT has only 
operated in the rail transportation industry, but there could be opportunities in trucking, 
providing value add services (e.g. repackaging for end vendors, pricing updates for tag), etc.

HAND INTERVIEWEE EXHIBIT 1. Our client is chiefly concerned about the profit 
margins in the East Coast market after its entry. Based on the provided 
information, what should CT¡¯s profit margins be in the East Coast? 
. A good candidate will describe the logic of their calculation before jumping directly into computing. If 
the candidate jumps in first, do not provide guidance unless asked to collaborate by interviewee. 
. Answer: 20% profit margin 
. Calculations: 
. 40% Market Share = $400M; $400-$320M= $80M profit or 20% profit margin 
. 35% Market Share = $350M; $350-$280M= $70M profit or 20% profit margin 
. 25% Market Share = $250M; $250-$200M= $50M profit or 20% profit margin 
. 1 ¨C (Sum of Costs / Industry Revenue) = 1 ¨C ($800M / $1000M) = 1- 0.8 = 0.2 = 20% 
. Takeaways: 
. Knowing the East Coast profit margin is 20%, the candidate should want to look at West Coast 
profitability to determine is the East Coast is an attractive market. This info isn¡¯t provided, but a 
good candidate will ask about this. 
. The candidate should also consider the initial investment to enter the market and the portion of 
the market that CT can expect to capture in order to conduct a break-even analysis.

Our internal analysts believe that CT can only capture 10% of the East Coast 
market upon entry in the first year. The West Coast market size is $2B, and 25% of 
that market is expected to shift to the East Coast after the canal opens in 2016. The 
initial investment to begin operations on the East Coast would be approximately 
$450M. Based upon this information when would CT break even? Ignore time 
value of money and assume no growth. 
. Answer: 15 years 
. $1.0B East Coast market in 2015 becomes approx. $1.5B in 2016 
. Client expects to have 10% of East Coast market share, or $150M in revenue w. 20% profit 
margin. 
. $30M profit in Y1, but initial invest was $450M. 
. Breakeven time period would be 15 years (i.e., $450M / $30M = 15), and the client¡¯s 
comfort with that horizon would lead next steps 
. A good candidate will describe the logic of their calculation before jumping directly 
into computing. If the candidate jumps in first, do not provide guidance unless asked 
to collaborate by interviewee. 
. A strong candidate will connect 2015 data and project 2016 after 25% shift from 
West Coast and drive to the ¡°so what¡± of the prompt.

Given that it would take many years to recoup initial costs unless CT could gain a 
larger market share, what are some other recommendations for CT to increase 
profitability in the East Coast after the Panama Canal expansion? 
. A good candidate could mention several options, including: 
. Buy/Borrow 
. Increasing the number of services provided by CT (e.g. providing additional 
value add services such as repackaging or tagging) 
. Potential substitutes for rail (e.g. transport trucks) 
. Aggressive expansion of customer base through pricing strategy and leveraging 
existing West Coast network

Question 2:

Dealer Jack¡¯s 
111 
Your client is Dealer Jack¡¯s, a large US based grocery retailer with stores located on 
the East Coast. Dealer Jack¡¯s stores provide a full grocery offering with produce, deli, 
and fresh bakery departments and a mix of national and private label brands. The 
company, affectionately referred to as ¡°DJ¡¯s¡± by its customers, experienced strong 
growth for the better part of the past two decades outpacing the industry until recently. 
Over the past three years however, Dealer Jack¡¯s annual profits have stagnated and 
even declined in the past year while the grocery industry has continued to grow with 
hard discounters such as Trader Joe¡¯s leading the way. The CEO has been getting 
increasing pressure from the board to turn things around, and we have been hired to 
diagnose the cause of DJ¡¯s profitability issues and find ways to improve it. 
Prompt #1:

Dealer Jack¡¯s 
112 
. Candidate should recognize this is a profitability case and should develop a MECE framework 
that addresses both revenues and costs. 
. Dealer Jack¡¯s management has examined same store sales for all of its 300 locations, and 
profitability appears to be a pervasive issue across all stores. They do not believe targeting and 
closing underperforming stores is an appropriate solution. 
. While the Dealer Jack¡¯s brand is strong on the East Coast, management sees geographic 
expansion as too capital intensive in the short term. 
. All non-operating expenses/costs are appropriately benchmarked to the industry. 
. Private label brands are commonly referred to as store brands like 365 at Whole Foods or 
Kirkland¡¯s at Costco. Hard discounters such as Trader Joe¡¯s rely heavily on private label brands. 
National brands come from CPG firms such as General Mills or Kraft. CPG firms require a 
margin on their products that¡¯s not applicable to private label brands. 
. DJ¡¯s had 2016 revenue of $60 billion with 30% gross margin and 3% profit margin. 
. Management wants to increase the profits by 10% within the next year. 
¨C Note for Interviewer: Target profit increase is $180 million = $60 billion x 3% x 10%

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #1 
. Exhibit represents high level revenue 
broken down between national brands 
and private label brands as well high level 
profit. 
. Provide information about national brand 
vs private label brand differences from 
Interviewer Guidance on prior page if 
candidate asks and it wasn¡¯t previously 
covered. 
. Candidate should make connection 
between the stagnating private label 
growth and stagnating profits in the last 
three years. Interviewer should guide 
them in that direction if needed. Move to 
Prompt #2 when appropriate. 
. Candidate should draw the following 
insights: 
¨C Private label brand growth was driving profit growth 
in earlier years 
¨C Profits declined in the past year despite continued 
increases in revenue 
¨C Margins on private label brands might be more 
attractive than national brands and worth exploring 
further 
114 
Exhibit #1 Guidance: Analysis:

Dealer Jack¡¯s 
115 
Only 33% of all Dealer Jack¡¯s sales come from the higher margin private label brands 
compared to industry leader, Trader Joe¡¯s, which has 45% penetration. Management 
expects revenues to be flat in the coming year, but believes that by re-focusing on 
private label brands, Dealer Jack¡¯s could increase its private label sales penetration by 
3 percentage points without losing any sales dollars. 
Private label brands have a gross margin of 40% while national brands have a gross 
margin of 25% for Dealer Jack¡¯s. 
What do you think of management¡¯s hypothesis? 
Prompt #2:

Interviewer Math Guidance 
116 
. Candidate might ask about changes to other annual expenses. SG&A and other 
operating expenses are not expected to change by increasing private label 
penetration. Only COGS and taxes will change. Previous prompt does not provide tax 
info ¨C candidate should ask for this. The tax rate is 30%. 
. A good candidate will recognize that the total size of the revenue pie will not increase 
and the impact to profit is just the net increase in margin that comes from the 
transition from national brands to private label brands minus any increases in taxes. 
. Analysis: 
Interviewer Guidance/Analysis: 
2016 Revenue $60 billion 
x Private label penetration increase x 3% (= $1.8 B) 
x Difference in gross margin x 15% that is, (40% - 25%) 
= Increase to gross margin = $270 million ( = $1.8 B * 15%) 
- Taxes - $81 million : ($270 million x 30%) 
= Increase in Profit = $189 million 

Dealer Jack¡¯s 
117 
. The CEO is about to walk into the room. What is your recommendation and what else 
should the management team consider? 
Recommendation 
. Candidate should recognize that executing management¡¯s plan to increase private 
label penetration by 3 percentage points will meet and exceed the 10% or $180 
million profit increase goal. 
. A good candidate will: 
¨C Identify the need to pressure-test the assumption on 3% sales increase estimate 
¨C Identify risks such as needing to understand more about any upfront/onetime costs that will 
be associated with re-focusing on private label brands. 
¨C Suggest next steps such as rolling out a pilot program in select stores. 
. An excellent candidate might also note: 
¨C There will still a significant gap in private label penetration between Dealer Jack¡¯s and 
industry leader Trader Joe¡¯s implying some additional room for upside. 
¨C Increasing private label penetration could strain sourcing relationships with national 
brand/CPG suppliers or how sourcing fewer national brand products could diminish 
economies of scale, further decreasing margins for remaining national brand sales.

. This case is meant to be driven by interviewee, allow him/her to drive the case after 
each prompt and respond with ¡°ands¡± if depth of explanation does not make path 
forward clear. 
. Most candidates will recognize that this is a profitability case. But a good candidate will 
see aspects of market entry and tailor their problem solving accordingly. Additionally, he 
or she will focus on the qualitative aspects of the beer industry. 
. Interviewee should develop a MECE framework, some example buckets are: External: 
market factors, customer demand, regulatory concerns; Revenue: pricing strategy, 
volume, service offerings; Costs: ID variable and fixed cost, benchmarking competitors; 
Market: Competition, market share, barriers to entry; Entry: acquisition, JV, build from 
ground up 
. Drive the interviewee to think about trends in the beer market in the US and if those will 
apply abroad. You can coach the interviewee to use real life examples of what they 
know about the craft industry. 
. Exhibits should be handed out as the interviewee asks for certain aspects. They should 
realize that the client has a large market share (and power), that there is potential in the 
UK for craft and specifically for the style of beer known as India Pale Ale (IPA).

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
. Exhibit shows recent trends in sales by 
style of beer 
. The IPA category has shown the biggest 
increase in sales 
. A good candidate will connect this with 
the lack of competition in a style of beer 
that is increasing in popularity 
. This should lead the candidate to want to 
specifically choose the style of India Pale 
Ale (IPA) as the style to analyze for 
potential export 
. At this point, the interviewee should explore 
entering the UK craft market with an IPA as 
the product.

. What factors would influence this decision to go abroad? 
Prompt #2: 
. Interviewee should be allowed to take a few minutes and brain-storm in a MECE 
fashion. Some of the factors could be as following 
. Internal: Cash on hand for CapEx, Knowledge of the UK market &Marketing 
strategy 
. External: Competition, Barriers to entry, Distribution channels, Tariffs, Regulatory 
concerns, Converting a traditional beer culture into a more craft-oriented culture, 
Shipping costs if brewed in the US, Costs if brewed locally in the UK, US price 
points vs. UK price points, Added costs to expand the supply chain (more hops, 
bottles, packaging) 
. Other: Legal drinking age in UK, Brexit, USD to Euro conversions and volatility 
Interviewer Guidance:

Duck Island Beer Co. 
129 
. Our internal strategy team has decided that: 
¨C The market is favorable for entry 
¨C We want to launch our flagship beer the ¡°Duck Island IPA¡± 
¨C We want you to provide your analysis on one of two methods of entry 
1. Brew in the US and export to the UK 
2. Brew locally in the UK and brand it as a US Beer 
- Which one do you recommend and why? 
Prompt #3: 
Share the following data estimated by the internal strategy team verbally with the caser. Coach 
him/her to come up with profitability and recommendation 
. General Data 
¨C Estimated sales in 1st year = 2,000 Barrels 
¨C Price = $10 per 6 Pack 
¨C 165 12 oz. Bottles in a . Barrel 
. Imported from US 
¨C Cost of brewing = $0.50 per Bottle 
¨C Cost of shipping = $0.50 per Bottle 
¨C Tariffs for a 6 pack of bottles = $1 per 6 Pack 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. Brewed in UK 
Cost of Brewing = $0.50 per Bottle 
Cost of shipping = $0.50 per Bottle 
No Tariffs 
CapEx for new brewery operations 
= $110,000

130 
. The profitability should come out as $330,000 for both scenarios calculated as follows: 
Total number of bottles = 2000 Barrels x (165 x 2) Bottles/Barrels = 660,000 
Revenues: $ 10/ six pack * 660,000/6= $ 1.1 M 
Cost of importing from the US: (Cost of brewing/bottle + Cost of shipping per bottle + Tariff per 
bottle) x Number of bottles = (0.5 + 0.5 + (1/6)) x 660,000 = $ 770,000 
Total cost of brewing in UK = (0.5+0.5) x 660,000 + 110,000 = $ 770, 000 
Total Profits in both case = $ 1.1 M - $ 0.77 M = $ 0.33 M = $ 330,000 
. The candidate can choose to brew in the US and see the potential growth as it being marketed 
as an ¡°imported US beer¡± 
. The candidate can also choose to brew in the UK and recognize that after the first year CapEx, 
they can have higher profit with lower costs

Behavioral Questions 
133 
. Why are you interested in Human Capital consulting? 
¨C The candidate should emphasize why they are drawn to HC consulting (likely with Deloitte) 
rather than S&O or Tech. They should emphasize past work experience, or interests peaked 
in business school in working specifically on people related problems. 
Question 1: 
. What city do you want to be in and why? 
¨C Interviewee should have good reasons for targeting specific city/office: 
. Personal connections to city: family/friends 
. Talked with people from specific office and feel like it is a good fit 
. Industry interests specific to office 
Question 2:

FoodXperts 
. Your client CARE FIRST (CF) is a large hospital system, comprising 100 acute 
general medicine hospitals across the US employing over 200,000 people 
nationwide. CF¡¯s patient mix are covered by a variety of insurance providers, 
however, the majority of patients are covered by Medicare and Medicaid. In the last 
five years, CF has acquired 70 hospitals in rural regions, increasing the number of 
patients it serves by 40%. For the last 10 years, CF has been outsourcing their 
foodservice needs to one contract vendor, FoodXperts. FoodXperts handles all inroom 
patient dining, cafeteria, retail dining and employs all staff and management as 
they relate to foodservice in CF¡¯s hospitals. 
. Due to policy changes and emphasis on value based care, patient satisfaction, 
measured through HCAHPS scores, is now factored into hospital reimbursement 
rates from Medicare and Medicaid. CF has recently seen a decline in their 
reimbursement rates and believes it may be due to the low quality food and service 
that FoodXperts has been providing. CF has decided to end their contract with 
FoodXperts at the end of the next year and to begin self-operating foodservices on 
their own. By making this shift, CF will have to replace all staff and management that 
has been employed by FoodXperts. 
. CF is worried that CEO¡¯s at individual hospitals will not be invested in this decision 
and will likely push back to keep outsourcing foodservice at their individual hospitals. 
Prompt: 
134

FoodXperts 
. CF has asked your team to help them in planning for the transition to self-operating 
foodservices across the entire hospital system and replacing FoodXperts 
management and staff. How would you assist CF through this large scale change? 
. Guiding Questions: 
¨C Who are the stakeholders involved? 
¨C What phases would you propose to roll out this transition to self-operate 
foodservice? 
¨C What are the anticipated challenges you foresee? 
Prompt (continued): 
. This case is meant to mimic a typical Deloitte human capital case with a longer 
prompt and includes more information than necessary. Make sure to read the 
prompt at a normal pace so that the candidate can practice taking quick abbreviated 
notes. 
. Different than strategy cases, the candidate should summarize the prompt telling you 
the ¡°story¡± and problem facing the client. 
. Human capital cases are meant to be conversational, after reviewing the prompt and 
asking follow up questions, the candidate should take a few minutes to framework 
their thoughts before beginning their explanation. 
Interviewer Guidance: 
135

FoodXperts 
. What is CF¡¯s organization structure? 
¨C CF headquarters is located in New York and has hospitals across the US in both rural and 
urban areas. Most decisions are made centrally at headquarters but CEO¡¯s of individual 
hospitals have some flexibility to modify plans if they can prove that it will be better for their 
patients overall. 
. How many FTE are employed by FoodXperts? 
¨C 5% of employees at CF are currently under FoodXperts management and would leave at the 
end of the contract. 
. Candidate should know there are 200K employees and therefore know CF will need to 
hire 10K people across all of their hospitals. 
. Has CF ever done something like this in the past? 
¨C Yes, CF used to outsource healthcare technology to another vendor and decided to selfoperate 
this division a few years ago. The decision was abrupt and they lost a lot of great 
talent from the current vendor (that might have stayed on) due to poor messaging from 
leadership. Some CEO¡¯s of individual hospitals disagreed with the decision and have been 
weary of other changes mandated from headquarters. 
. Why is this change taking place? What are the main objectives of this change? 
¨C The candidate should have this information from the prompt and should emphasize these in 
their explanation. If not: the change is happening because of declining patient satisfaction 
scores and thus lower reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid. The main objective is 
have a smooth transition to self-operating foodservice in an effort to increase patient 
satisfaction and reimbursement rates across the system. 
Additional Information (if requested): 
136

FoodXperts 
Candidate can use assess, design, deploy framework. Candidate may have some but 
not all listed below in their framework. 3-4 workstreams are suggested for timing 
purposes. 
. Assess 
¨C Stakeholder Analysis: Conduct a stakeholder analysis to identify key stakeholders at each 
individual hospital: CEO¡¯s/Foodservice managers, FoodXpert staff/management that might be 
retained after contract is terminated. 
¨C Change Impact Assessment: Conduct a change impact analysis (i.e. a forum for those 
impacted stakeholders) to identify concerns about the self-operating foodservice, especially 
those that might come from the recent healthcare technology change. Document all 
procedural changes that will need to be addressed via hiring and communications. 
. Design: 
¨C Hiring plan: Work with hospital CEO/Foodservice managers to create plan to retain 
management and staff currently employed by FoodXperts. Develop plan with central HR to fill 
remaining gaps at hospital level. 
¨C Communications: Design a communications plan documenting all communications that will be 
delivered to stakeholders. This plan should outline what group of stakeholders should receive 
what message, the frequency of the communications, the vehicle of communication and the 
due date. 
¨C Learning & Development: plan for the integration of new employees to include onboarding, 
training, and future development needs. 
Recommendation 
137

FoodXperts 
. Design (continued): 
¨C Change Management: For such a large-scale change, it would be advantageous to create a 
Change Agent Network made up of ¡°change agents/champions¡± who will lead the new 
structure of foodservice operations and can be subject matter experts on the new system to 
self-operate foodservice and be the main point of contact that hospitals can go to with 
questions and concerns. The Change Agent Network would meet several times before the 
contract with FoodXperts is terminated to manage transition to self-operating foodservice and 
get the opportunity to answer any questions or address any concerns arising from colleagues. 
. Deploy: 
¨C Hiring: Roll out hiring plan from central office and assist CEOs in retaining high quality talent 
from FoodXperts (especially hospitals located in rural regions where talent might be more 
scarce). 
¨C Communications: Execute on the first communications that are meant to build awareness and 
investment from CEO¡¯s at hospital level. Work with CEOs to deploy messaging to FoodXperts 
staff/management that they want to be retained. 
¨C Change Management: Facilitate Change Network Meetings and inform all employees that the 
change agents will be the go-to people for questions regarding the change in foodservice so 
that management can carry on with day-to-day activities. 
. Note: candidate may want to have a trial run with small set of hospitals early on in the process to 
gather information and learn from the transition prior to rolling out to the entire system.

was the situation, how did you convince him/her, and what was your learning from it? 
Question 2:

NileKart 
141 
. Your client NileKart located in the Research Triangle Park (RTP) in Durham, is the 
nation¡¯s fastest growing e-commerce player with over $3 Billion in revenues in 2015. 
Most of this growth is inorganic with NileKart leveraging its seemingly endless cash 
reserves to acquire companies which strategically align with its long term vision of 
becoming the largest e-commerce company in the world. 
. NileKart¡¯s recent acquisitions include a fast growing logistics company based in 
Memphis, a 600 seater call centre based Austin and a Fintech start-up based in 
Silicon Valley. 
. In January 2016, under tremendous pressure from its VCs to continue its rapid 
growth, NileKart reluctantly completed the acquisition of WishDeal, a niche ecommerce 
company with over $500 Million in revenues in 2015. Wish Deal is based 
in Silicon Valley and was built by a young team of data scientists and developers 
which sells quirky, one-of-a-kind products at low prices. 
. The rationale behind this merger was to exploit economies of scale in operations, 
expanding consumer base and developing a diverse product portfolio as sources of 
competitive advantages in the highly saturated e-commerce industry in USA. 
Prompt #1:

NileKart 
142 
We have been engaged to help with creating a comprehensive technology integration 
plan with the following key considerations: 
. Who are the key stakeholders that need to be considered in order to achieve success 
of the technology integration? 
. Integrate NileKart¡¯s and WishDeal¡¯s technology systems into a single centralized 
platform where the combined entity can leverage economies of scale in operations. 
. What phases would you propose to roll-out the integration with broad timelines? 
. Highlight any key risks that NileKart faces in this integration. 
Prompt #1: 
. Human capital cases are conversational, but the candidate should take a few minutes 
to set up a framework for how they will approach EI¡¯s adoption of the new system. 
Prior to setting up their framework, the candidate is permitted to ask a few questions. 
If solicited, the interviewer can provide additional information provided in the slides to 
follow. If the candidate asks a question for which the answer is not provided, just 
reply that the information is not available. 
Interviewer Guidance:

NileKart 
143 
. The case is going to test the candidate¡¯s ability to think of both the strategic as well 
as the tactical aspects of integration from a human capital lens. The candidate may 
need the following additional information: 
1. Please describe the culture at NikeKart and WishDeal. 
. NileKart has a collaborative and entrepreneurial culture and its the leadership team is 
made up of seasoned industry veterans who control majority of the decision making 
and usually most initiatives in the firm have to receive a signoff from the leadership 
team before they get implemented. However, WishDeal has an agile, entrepreneurial 
and de-centralized culture where product managers and business heads are given a 
lot of freedom to implement initiatives and run their divisions independently. 
2. Why was NileKart reluctant in acquiring WishDeal? 
. NileKart¡¯s management felt that the company cultures were very different and rushing 
into a new, sizable acquisition without first consolidating its existing portfolio of 
acquired companies would not be beneficial to the company in the long run. 
3. How has NikeKart fared in its previous acquisitions? 
. 80% of NileKart¡¯s acquisitions have been successful in achieving the desired 
objectives. 
Additional Information (If solicited)

NileKart 
144 
4. Why is this integration important to both the companies? And is the 
Leadership Team aligned with the integration? 
. The rationale behind this merger was to exploit economies of scale in operations, 
expanding consumer base and developing a diverse product portfolio as sources of 
competitive advantages in the highly saturated e-commerce industry in USA. 
. The Leadership Team at NileKart is highly committed to make this merger successful 
but the Leadership Team at WishDeal is apprehensive about losing their agile culture 
and its focus on selling unique, quirky products to a younger customer base. 
5. What are the current technology systems at both the companies? 
. While both the companies use SAP as their ERP system, NileKart uses 
Salesforce.com¡¯s proprietary CRM system and WishDeal uses Zoho CRM¡¯s SaaS 
CRM system. Unifying both the CRMs will be a critical piece in ensuring the 
successful integration of the customer data and developing future business strategy 
for both the companies. 
6. Has NileKart given any specific timelines? (given the influence of VCs) 
. The Board comprising of several VC partners is hoping to successfully complete the 
integration of WishDeal into NileKart¡¯s operations in the next two years. 
Additional Information (If solicited)

NileKart 
145 
7. Are both the players selling similar products? Or what are the differences in 
customer base or go-to-market approach for both the companies? 
. While NileKart sells everything from a pin to a plane on its e-commerce platform with 
its customer base between the age groups of 21 ¨C 45, WishDeal focusses on selling 
unique, quirky items at low prices to its customers who are typically between the age 
groups of 16 ¨C 28. WishDeal leverages customer data analytics to deliver targeted 
marketing to its customer base and massive social media campaigns on Instagram, 
Pinterest and Snapchat. NileKart leverages traditional social media marketing 
8. Who are the end users of the unified CRM? 
. The end users will be the 800 employees of the Austin based call-center of NileKart 
along with a 60 member customer support team of WishDeal. The preference would 
be to migrate WishDeal¡¯s CRM data to the Salesforce.com CRM used by NileKart. 
9. Are there any change champions identified for the ERP and CRM integration 
project? 
. Yes, the CTOs of both the companies are championing the cause along with a 
special task force comprising of senior project managers along with the technology 
team and customer satisfaction team from the Austin based call-center.

Case Solution: Interviewer Guidance 
NileKart 
146 
. Note that there is a lot going on in the case which is typically the scenario during mergers 
and acquisitions. The key to effectively solving the case in 30 minutes is to acknowledge 
the breadth of issues upfront and identify 2-3 key issues that you would like to solve for 
given the limited time of the case discussion. 
. The interviewer needs to check for business acumen, identification of the key business 
issues in the case which are Technology and Culture Integration and the candidate¡¯s 
understanding of Human Capital concepts. Additionally, the candidate must address all 
the 4 questions raised in the beginning of the case, in some capacity during the case 
discussion. The case discussion will mostly be a conversation focussed on the 
candidate¡¯s approach to solving business problems using a Human Capital Lens 
. This table shows the typical structure for a 30 minute case

following four Human Capital casing frameworks: 
1. Lifecycle framework 
. The solution is shown as a series of next steps, with appropriate level of detailing, 
that need to be achieved over a defined period of time which can be in the form of a 
Gantt chart. 
2. Work Streams framework 
. The solution is given by going deeper into all case specific HC work streams. 
3. People ¨C Process ¨C Technology framework 
. The activities are divided by the areas of impact. For example People header has all 
the activities that will have an effect on people. 
4. Assess ¨C Design ¨C Deploy - Measure framework (with relevant workstreams) 
. The activities are divided according to various phases of the project implementation 
with a minimum of two workstreams in each phase with potential overlaps.

. Executive leadership teams of NileKart and WishDeal 
. Executive leadership teams of the logistics company based in Memphis, call centre in 
Austin and the Fintech start-up in the Silicon Valley ¨C to ensure seamless integration 
of services and to unlock the economies of scale in operations across both the firms 
. The VC partners who hold strategic interests in both the companies 
. CTOs and technology teams at NileKart and WishDeal 
. The employees at NileKart¡¯ call-center in Austin and the WishDeal¡¯s customer 
support team 
2. Integrating Technology systems into a single centralized platform: 
. Leadership Alignment: Survey leaders to see who would be allies to the project and 
start implementations by piloting across their divisions first; consider having positive 
leaders talk to other leaders who are not as enthusiastic; communicate with leaders 
how they will benefit from the system, what their role should be and how they will be 
awarded.

. Communications: Determine what messaging need to go out to different 
stakeholders, when it needs to go out and who should deliver it; consider having 
most messaging in in the call-center and in customer support teams to come from 
local office leadership and cascade down from there; communicate benefits of having 
a unified CRM platform; manage expectations by communicating that there will be a 
learning curve and an initial loss of productivity during the transition 
. Incentives: Come up with visible ways to award and recognize stakeholders that 
move the project forward (e.g., recognition to the office that have the highest level); 
celebrate milestones and achievements 
. Stakeholder Engagement: Find change champions, who are positive and 
understand the business, to engage employees and listen for feedback on the 
implementation; consider that there are different languages and cultures in each 
office and a ¡°one-size-fits-all¡± approach may not work 
. Training: Revamp trainings so they address specific business needs of the local 
offices, which will take a thorough understanding of the current business processes 
and how they will change with the migration of WishDeal¡¯s customer data to 
Salesforce.com CRM platform

3. The key risks that NileKart faces include: 
. Attrition of Top Talent especially in the engineering and product management teams 
. Loss of WishDeal customer base who might switch to competitors fearing loss of 
quality and changes in customer service standards 
. Loss of employee morale due to differences in company cultures and leadership 
styles 
. Competitors moving in rapidly to capture market share in case of a failed integration 
. Loss of brand value of the firm due to a failed integration resulting in lower valuation 
of NileKart which leads to potential losses for the VCs

Question 1: 
. What would your previous manager say are 2 natural strengths? Provide an example 
of how you leveraged your strengths to succeed in a difficult project or situation. 
Question 2:

Fresher Breath 
154 
. Your client, Minty Fresh Co. has been the dominant leader in Oral Mouthwash for 
over a century since inventing a unique four oil combination that kills 99% of germs 
and leaves consumers with a ¡°dentist fresh¡± clean feeling. Minty Fresh has 
consistently held 80-90% of the market share for mouthwash, but in the last 3 years, 
share and profit has been rapidly declining. Your client, the CEO of the US division, 
has hired you to determine what is driving the decline and how to quickly reverse this 
trend. 
Prompt #1: 
. This case will only be focused on US sales, global impact is ignored. 
. If asked, assume you are in January 2016. In later parts of the case it will be helpful 
to keep in mind that results need to be achieved within the 11 remaining months of 
the 2016. 
. Minty Fresh only sells mouthwash, not other oral care products 
. Most common framework would be centered around revenue and profit. The case will 
go towards revenue drivers, but interviewee should explore both. Competition should 
be included in the framework as share is mentioned. 
Interviewer Guidance:

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
. The ¡°key question¡± to provide exhibit 1 would be around 
competitive landscape. If they go towards a different 
path or two, it is ok to say ¡°There has been major 
competitive activity in the last few years, so the CEO 
wants us to start there¡± 
. The interviewee should identify: 
¨C Minty Fresh is declining 
¨C 2 new competitors have quickly taken share in the 
market in the last 3 years 
¨C The category is relatively flat thus this is a case of 
stealing share, not growing the entire category. 
. AFTER the interviewee reviews, move forward with the 
following prompt: 
¨C Mouthwash is a consumer category that has had 
relatively flat household penetration for almost a 
decade, thus the new competitors are stealing 
share rather than growing the market. Given the 
fierce competitive environment, our client needs a 
quick action to help turn around the decline. Our 
client has aligned with the board that she will turn 
around the decline and even grow share by 3 
percentage points in 2016. 
1. Assuming the category remains flat, what is the 
increased revenue needed to hit a 3 percentage point 
market share growth? 
2. What are some strategies Minty Fresh should consider 
to quickly regain the share? 
. Q1 Math: Current share in 2015 is 770/1100 or 70%; 
Assuming the category is flat, 3 percentage points 
equals ~$33MM (this number will be needed in later 
questions) 
. For Q2 the interviewee should have some elements of a 
marketing and/or revenue framework: price and volume, 
volume could be broken into new products, increase buy 
rate of current users, new retail customers (i.e. gas 
stations, beauty stores) 
. An good interviewee will keep in mind the time line and 
recognize that a new product launch or even new retail 
customers may be difficult to achieve in the short time 
frame. Thus, pricing will be the quickest way to move 
towards increased share

. Prompt: Given that pricing will be a 
quick way to impact 2016 share, your 
team pulled together list prices for 
Minty Fresh and its 2 top 
competitors. They were also able to 
obtain 2015 volumes for Minty Fresh. 
. Interviewee should recognize there are different 
bottle sizes and price points, which vary across 
competitors 
. Ultimately, the goal is to notice: 
¨C Minty Fresh is underpriced versus 
competitors in 250ML and 500ML and has 
an opportunity to increase price 
¨C Minty Fresh is over priced in 1L and 1.5L; 
Interviewee could argue that they are a 
premium brand and should maintain a 
higher price, but should be going towards 
exploring the impact of elasticity on price 
. A good interviewee should mention elasticity 
and how that could help improve 
revenues/share 
. The bottom chart will be used in Prompt 3 
analysis, but interviewee may note that 1 and 
1.5L are much bigger impact to revenue than 
250 and 500 ML. They could also calculate the 
2015 revenue by size

1. An analyst on your team calculated price elasticities of different sized bottles of Minty Fresh. The proposed changes are 
within the boundaries of retailer contracts and are what your team thinks are the max price changes Minty Fresh could make 
without negative profit impact. With the following data, can Minty Fresh hit their incremental sales target? Assume that 2015 
sales and volume are the starting point. 
¨C For 250 ML, 20% price increase drives a 10% volume decrease 
¨C For 500ML, a 15% price increase drives a 10% volume decrease 
¨C For 1ML, a 20% price decrease drives a 30% volume increase 
¨C For 1.5ML a 15% price decrease drives a 20% volume increase 
2. After calculations: What factors would need to be considered to implement a price change? 
Prompt #3: 
. The interviewee will need to use the data from the previous exhibit to do this analysis. It is not expected to do this in his/her 
head; a good organized table will be needed (one example below). If struggling, interviewee could just calculate 1L and 1.5L 
and talk to other ways to get to the revenue increase 
. For analysis, assume competitors don¡¯t change their prices (put should be a factor in Q2). 
. Q2: End Consumers, Retailers, Internal Supply chain, Profit Impact, Competitor Reaction (not exhaustive) 
. The interviewee should have the $33MM from Prompt 1; this analysis gets you to ~$30MM which is close enough to move 
forward. However, interviewee can recommend to not move forward if they defend their argument.

to improve her business? 
Recommendation 
. Response should include results, risks/watch outs and next steps 
. Summary results should include if the sales target is achievable and by what actions. 
It should also include risks of consumer/retailer reaction to price increases, ¡°price

. Next steps could include working with retailers to roll through changes, aligning new 
volumes with supply chain, thinking through other marketing efforts (TV ads, digital),

The CEO of a nonprofit performing arts theatre has approached us because despite 
increasing attendance, the theatre¡¯s profit margins have been declining over the past 5 
years. The CEO wants you to help him identify what may be causing the decline and 
what steps he might take to turn around the trend. What would you recommend the 
CEO consider to help ensure sufficient operating funds for the theatre into the future? 
Prompt #1: 
The interviewee may ask the following questions; provide the following information only if requested: 
. The theatre produces its own shows, and has an in-house crew and cast of actors and actresses. It also recruits actors from 
New York who are part of the Actors Equity Association to perform in certain musicals. 
. The theatre only produces professional musicals for which it pays a one-time licensing fee to obtain the scripts and musical 
books. 
. In the summer, the theatre also produces children¡¯s shows, but they are much simpler productions and the cost of 
production is negligible. 
. Overall goal is to achieve the profit margins the theatre had in 2010 (12%). 
. The theatre has 850 seats. 
. Broadly speaking, the musical theatre industry has seen increasing attendance in recent years as a result of increasing 
youth interests. We¡¯ve seen an uptick of 2% attendance overall over the past 5 years. 
. There are no competitors of similar size or quality in the area. 
. The theatre¡¯s ultimate objective is not to maximize profitability, but the CEO wants to ensure that there are sufficient 
reserves for future repairs and to cover losses on certain musicals.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit 
. Interviewer Prompt: 
Our team has taken an initial look at the cost of 
operating the theatre in 2010 and 2015. 
Please look at this exhibit and tell me what you 
can extract from it. 
Potential questions: 
- Overhead includes expenses like accounting 
services, technical equipment, repairs and 
maintenance, building supplies, and rental 
space 
- Payroll includes salaries, health insurance, 
and parking benefits for full-time administrative 
staff 
- Cost of shows includes playbill printing 
expenses, advertising expenses, talent, 
rehearsal space, costumes, props, musicians, 
royalties and scripts 
. After reviewing this chart, the candidate 
should immediately recognize that cost of 
shows has nearly doubled (as a percentage 
of the total) in the past 5 years and now 
accounts for more than 50% of the theatre¡¯s 
budget. 
. The interviewer should prompt the candidate 
to drive the case forward by hypothesizing 
about what may have caused the increase in 
cost of shows over the past 5 years. 
Reasons considered may include: 
. Cost of obtaining rights to produce the shows 
. Cost of staff 
. Lodging for talent/actors 
. Cost of marketing and promotion 
. Once the candidate has identified the cost of 
talent (mainly, actors) as a potential key 
factor in operating income decline, you 
should move to prompt 2. 
164 
Exhibit #1 Guidance: Guidance and Analysis, cont:

165 
The cost of production has increased dramatically because beginning in 2011, the theatre underwent a 
massive effort to improve the quality of its plays and musicals. This effort to ¡°bring Broadway home¡± 
included bringing in members of the Actors Equity Association, a professional organization (think union) for 
Broadway-level actors that ensures them certain workers¡¯ protections as well as a base level of pay. 
Feedback related to the actors from patrons has been very positive, and reviews of the theatre¡¯s 
performances have improved. The director is not interested in eliminating actors from the Actors Equity 
Association, but what other options (beyond cost) might he consider to help him boost his gross profit? 
Prompt #2: 
Here, the candidate may list some of the following ideas during the brainstorm: 
. Generate new revenue streams through in-house initiatives like adding concessions and alcoholic 
beverages or dramatically improving fundraising efforts 
. Develop new strategies for generating revenue through entering adjacencies like showing movies 
on nights when there are no in-house productions 
. Change the price of tickets to balance increased costs from new talent. 
The candidate should be encouraged to arrive at the pricing component.

The CEO agrees that it has been far too long since ticket pricing has been re-evaluated. What information 
would you need to evaluate current and new pricing strategies? (here, pause to let candidate generate ideas for 
what information would be helpful unless they¡¯ve already mentioned everything in their framework). 
The current tickets are priced on a two-tiered structure, $30 for seats on the main floor and $20 for seats in the 
balcony. There are 450 seats on the floor level, and 400 in the balcony. There are typically 16 performances 
of each show, and the theatre does 5 professional productions per year. Capacity is, on average, 85% for the 
floor level and 90% for the balcony. 
Prompt #3: 
Interviewer guidance: 
Total revenue: 
. $30 x 450 x 85% capacity = $11,475 
. $20 (balcony seat) x 400 balcony seats x 90% capacity = $7,200 
. Total revenue per show (not including concessions) = $18,675 
. $18,675 x 16 performances of each show = $298,800 
. $298,800 max revenue per production x 5 productions per year = $1,494,000 total revenue from productions 
. Gross profit = $1,494,000 revenue - $1,344,600 cost = $149,400 
. Gross profit margin $149,400 / $1,494,000 = 10% 
. Prompt on next page for continued analysis 
Interviewer Guidance:

Off-Broadway Blues 
167 
Note: 90% utilization is assumed because of lower price 
. 12% profit margin goal: Gross Profits/Revenues = 0.12 => (Revenue ¨CCost)/Revenue =0.12 
where cost is $1,344,600 
. => New revenue = Cost/0.88 = $1,344,600 / 0.88 = $1,530,000 
Once the candidate has solved for the new revenue, they can find the necessary ticket 
price 
. New ticket price: $1,530,000 = 0.9 (Seat utilization) x 16 (number of times a show plays) x 5 
(total number of shows) x 850 (total seats including balcony and floor) x P (Price) 
. => P = $25 
Interviewer Guidance cont: 
Regarding new pricing model, the CEO is interested in adopting one price throughout the 
theatre so as to avoid the impression that the balcony seats are less desirable. However, he 
does not want the ticket price to be above $35/ticket. 
Looking at the analysis you just performed, by how much would the CEO need to increase 
gross profit to hit 12% margins? 
Prompt #3 cont:

Off-Broadway Blues 
168 
. The CEO will be coming in for a meeting later this afternoon. What is your 
recommendation? 
Recommendation 
. The candidate can use creativity in developing an answer here. While the $25 
price/ticket should be included, the candidate can mention that the CEO may have 
more bandwidth to increase price above that level given past success at selling 
tickets at $30. 
. Candidate could also mention alternate strategies for increasing revenue, such as 
major fundraising efforts. 
. Strong candidate will also tie in qualitative factors like the importance of selecting 
plays that the audience is interested in, optimized scheduling of performances, 
expanding presence in the community through other events like movie screenings or 
seniors¡¯ plays, etc.

Galactica¡¯s Epic Struggle 
171 
Your client is Galactica, a market leader in on-premise data warehousing and analytics technology. It 
makes money by selling hardware and software to large companies, as well as assisting them with 
tracking, storing, and analyzing their data. Galactica has a decentralized organizational structure and has 
offices in 40 countries, each run independently without much interference from corporate. 
Over the past several years Galactica¡¯s growth and profitability has declined due to large cloud providers, 
such as Amazon and Microsoft, taking a chunk of the market through their massive scale and resources. 
Last year, for the first time in its history, Galactica showed an annual loss. 
We have been hired to find ways to cut costs while not sacrificing profitability. 
Prompt #1:

Galactica¡¯s Epic Struggle 
On Premise / Cloud 
. On premise means that physical servers required to store and analyze data are housed at a client¡¯s office. Cloud 
providers, on the other hand, host data virtually and clients access their data through the internet. Think storing a 
file on your computer in your house vs. on Dropbox. 
. Galactica competes primarily with other large tech companies such as IBM and Oracle in the on premise space. 
. The on premise data warehousing market has had flat growth the last three years and it is not expected to grow 
significantly going forward. 
. Galactica does have a cloud offering, but it is small and cannot match the cost and services of the cloud market 
leaders. It does not believe it will be able to change this in the near term. 
Org. 
. Galactica is based in the US, but has clients globally. It had roughly $3B of revenue last year and is publically 
traded. 
. Galactica¡¯s decentralized organizational structure means that each country has near full autonomy on how 
operations are run in that country and also employs a full support staff of back office functions. 
. R&D spend and executive comp. takes place at the corporate level and is allocated proportionately to each 
country. 
Goals 
. We have been hired to solely focus on cost cutting. Galactica is working on growth strategies internally. 
. Interviewee should build a framework that focuses mainly on ways to cut costs along with suggestions to achieve 
those cuts. 
. After walking through their framework they should ask for data to perform further analysis. If they don¡¯t ask, 
nudge them in that direction.

Guidance on Exhibit 1 ¨C Part 1 
1. Begin by asking the interviewee to walk you through the exhibit qualitatively. He or she should come to the 
following conclusions: 
. Austria: Galactica is the market leader in Austria, however there¡¯s limited room to grow due to the small 
market size and the fact that they already serve 80% of it. Furthermore, it¡¯s feasible that Austrian clients could 
be served from Germany. 
. Japan is the largest market shown and while Galactica isn¡¯t the market leader the high sales staff utilization 
indicates that they¡¯re actively chasing down new leads and have high potential to grow. 
. Egypt has the smallest revenue and while there is room to grow, there should be concern that due to low staff 
utilization and its position as the 3rd player in the market that it may have a hard time gaining traction. 
. Germany is the largest country in terms of revenue and the high sales utilization and top market position 
makes Germany look very strong. 
2. After walking you through the exhibit, the interviewee should identify that this is a cost case and that the 
exhibit contains no cost information. They should ask if we have this information so by country. 
. If they ask for this immediately, ask them to walk through the exhibit before providing the cost information 
. If the interviewee starts discussing ways to grow revenue or improving our market position nudge them back to 
remembering that this is a cost case. 
. The interviewee may suggest that we could cut costs by reducing the sales staff in the low utilization countries. 
This is a reasonable idea, but it should be assumed that the staff levels have been cut as much as possible and 
the low utilization is due to limited opportunities, not a bloated sales staff. 
. If the interviewee appears lost, ask if having additional cost information would help them in their analysis. If they 
say yes, then ask them what they¡¯d like to know, don¡¯t just give it to them. 
174 
Exhibit #1 Guidance (Part 1):

Guidance on Exhibit 1 ¨C Part 2 
3. After the interviewee requests cost data, give them the following information upon request (don¡¯t volunteer 
anything that wasn¡¯t specifically asked for). He or she should move to calculate the profit by country, but if 
he/she doesn¡¯t, nudge them in that direction. 
. COGS: 
. Austria: $45M 
. Japan: $70M 
. Egypt: $30M 
. Germany: $195M 
. SG&A: $30M for all countries 
. if asked, it should be assumed that this includes all other costs associated with running the office 
including depreciation and all allocated corporate overhead 
. Tax rate: 40% for all countries 
. The interviewee might point out that the cost structure might increase if an office is closed due to increased 
corporate overhead being assigned to the remaining offices. This is a good point, however assume that all 
corporate overhead costs are unavoidable and as such shouldn¡¯t be considered for this decision. 
4. Following the math, the interviewee should be able to immediately identify that Egypt is a good country to 
exit. Strong candidates might also point out that Austria could also be exited due to its low margin 
compared to Japan and Germany. Furthermore, since Germany¡¯s sales staff is 90% utilized it could use 
the additional resources from Austria to further expand. Lastly, the candidate could point out that it¡¯s 
feasible for Germany to support Austrian clients due to the close proximity and same language.

What non-financial factors should Galactica consider when exiting a country? How can they 
mitigate any risks associated with these factors? 
Prompt #2:

Galactica¡¯s Epic Struggle 
178 
. The interviewee can mention several factors here such as: 
¨C Difficulty in closing offices (severance, labor laws, other associated costs) 
¨C Bad signal to the market and Galactica¡¯s other customers 
¨C Loss of key talent 
¨C Potential death spiral of increased corporate overhead due to fewer offices to spread the cost 
across 
¨C Damage to morale 
. Great candidates will also point out the political difficulties associated with exiting countries because of 
their decentralized organization structure and the fact that each country has been run largely 
independently. 
. The interviewee should have reasonable mitigations for each factor they mentioned. Ideally they will 
have two or three for each factor. Both the risks and the mitigations should be expressed in as 
structured a way as possible (e.g. a grid outlining the risks and mitigations) 
Interviewer Guidance:

Galactica¡¯s Epic Struggle 
179 
The CEO is walking in the door now and would like to know what you suggest she do. 
Recommendation 
. Good recommendation: Galactica should exit out of the Egyptian market due to numerous factors 
including a loss of $10 million a year, a low sales staff utilization, and that we¡¯re just the 3rd player in the 
market. Some risks associated with this decision is that it could have negative effects on morale and we 
could lose some key talent. Our next steps should be to prepare strong communication to explain the 
decision to counter the potential morale issue and approach key talent on transfer opportunities. 
. Great recommendation: Galactica should exit out of the Egyptian and Austrian markets. Egypt is losing 
$10 million a year and we¡¯re not a major player in that market and seem to be struggling to gain 
traction. Austria is profitable, but just barely and due to the limited upside of its market and the fact 
that we could likely serve our current clients from Germany we could save substantial SG&A costs by 
closing the office. The biggest risk with this decision is working through the political nature of closing an 
office that has been run largely independently and may fight the decision, especially Austria due to 
their current profitability. Next steps should be to prepare a compelling financial model for exiting both 
markets and to ensure that we will be able to serve our Austrian clients from Germany.

Question 2:

Thrill Park 
182 
. Our client is Amusement Worldwide, an international amusement park company. Amusement 
Worldwide owns and operates dozens of parks around the world. These parks are regional parks, 
where visitors drive to the park for the day and not resort destinations, to which visitors travel 
great distances. 
. Amusement Worldwide has been quite successful recently and is looking to grow inorganically, 
with a budget of up to $1.5B. We¡¯ve been hired to evaluate whether or not they should acquire a 
local amusement park called Thrill Park, which is very popular in a region in which Amusement 
Worldwide is not currently present. 
. What are the important considerations when evaluating Thrill Park? 
Prompt #1: 
. This is an M&A case and the interviewee should come up framework that works towards a 
valuation 
. Thrill Park is a single park in North Carolina and is privately owned. It caters to guests of all ages 
(e.g., attractions range from simple shows and rides for young children to extreme rollercoasters 
which make adults ask their friends ¡°did you guys keep your eyes open the whole time?¡±). This is 
similar to current AW parks. 
. Amusement Worldwide has excess cash on hand and would just like to make a positive 
investment. 
. We can¡¯t get detail financial/operating data from Thrill Park, but fortunately Amusement 
Worldwide has lots of experience in this space and can provide us with estimates.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #1 
. We have come up with some projections 
for Thrill Park attendance this year 
. Eventually ask what the total amount from 
ticket sales is 
. If asked: 
¨C The park is open 150 days a year 
(seasonal) 
. Revenue from ticket sales calculation: 
¨C 10000 guests/ day x 150 days / year = 
1.5M guests/year 
¨C 1.5M guests/year * $50/guest = 
$75M/yr

Exhibit #1 Guidance: Analysis:

Thrill Park 
185 
. We have done some additional research on the costs of running a park of this size and what 
representative concessions and merchandise sales look like 
¨C Thrill Park costs $60M/yr to run, including operating, upkeep and administrative costs 
¨C The average guest spends $20/day on food, 50% of which is profit for Thrill Park 
¨C There are two types of guests in terms of souvenir purchases: Collectors and Casual guests 
25% of the guests are collectors spend an average of $36 
The rest of the guests are casual guests spend an average of $12 
Prompt #2: 
. What is the annual profit for Thrill Park? 
. Provide only if asked: 
¨C The profit margin on merchandise is two thirds (67%) 
. Profit Calculation 
¨C Ticket Revenue = $75M, Running Costs = $60M, Profit = $15M 
¨C Food Revenue = $20 x 1.5M = $30M, Food Profit = $30M x 50% = $15M 
¨C Merchandise Revenue = ($36 x 25% + $12 x 75%) x 1.5M = ($9 + $9) x 1.5M = $27M, 
Merchandise Profit = $27M x 67% = $18M 
¨C Total Profit = $15M + $15M + $18M= $48M

. What is the fair value of Thrill Park if the profit grows at 3% per year assuming an 8% discount 
rate? 
. Alternatively, just give 5% discount rate with no growth. 
Prompt #3: 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. Growing perpetuity formula = Dividend or coupon value / discount rate ¨C growth rate 
. $48M/(0.08-0.03)= $960M

Thrill Park 
187 
. What are some other factors Amusement Worldwide should consider when deciding to buy Thrill 
Park? 
Prompt #4: 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. This is a brainstorm question, notes (non-exhaustive): 
¨C Great answers would note that there will likely be a premium paid in the acquisition, which 
could be recovered by both revenue and costs synergies and provide value to Amusement 
Worldwide strategically 
¨C Good answers will list risks (e.g., hurting Thrill Park brand, better alternatives to capital, 
inaccurate projections/estimates) 
¨C Other considerations could include: 
. Is Thrill Park older or newer? Old rides & equipment might require replacement 
. Does Thrill Park have any local competitors? Acquire for strategic reasons? 
. Benefits of branding, consolidation, etc.

Thrill Park 
188 
. Our client claims that it would be able to make Thrill Park more profitable than it is currently, due 
to it¡¯s strong brand image, operational expertise, and purchasing power. Specifically, Amusement 
Worldwide thinks it could increase ticket sales of Thrill Park by 10%, while cutting the operating 
costs by 5% and the cost of food by 10%. Due to the existing supplier contract, they do not 
believe they will realize any savings in merchandise purchasing. 
. What is the total economic benefit of Amusement Worldwide owning Thrill Park? 
Prompt #5 (Optional): 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. Assume all the synergies would be fully realized in year 1 and have same growth rate as before. 
. Revenue (ticket sales) synergies: $75M x 10% = $7.5M 
. Operating cost synergies: $60M x 5% = $3M 
. Food cost synergies: ($30M - $15M) x 10% = $1.5M 
. Total synergies = $7.5M + $3M + $1.5M = $12M/yr 
. NPV of synergies = $12M/( 8% - 3%) = $240M

Thrill Park 
189 
. Thrill Park has told Amusement Worldwide it would be willing to sell itself for a price of $1.1B (a 
premium of $140M). Should Amusement Worldwide accept this offer? 
Prompt #6 (Optional): 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. Yes, Amusement Worldwide should accept the offer to buy Thrill Park for $1.1B, as the Thrill Park 
would be worth up to $1.2B ($960M + $240M) for Amusement Worldwide. In other words, the 
$140M premium paid is less than the $240M in expected increased profits because of the sale.

Thrill Park 
190 
. What are some additional ways that Thrill Park could potentially become more profitable? 
Prompt #7 (Very optional): 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. Additional brainstorm, if needed. Answers might include: 
. Current Operations 
¨C Get local/national sponsorships and suppliers 
¨C Charge for parking 
¨C Open for more days 
¨C More marketing 
. New Operations 
¨C Change business model ¨C open hotel/resort 
¨C Offer season tickets, bundling, dynamic pricing 
¨C New rides/attractions to boost attendance 
¨C Charge people for the ability to skip lines

Thrill Park 
191 
. Worried that Thrill Park might not continue to bring in enough guests to remain profitable, 
Amusement Worldwide wants us to check 
. Given the ticket price, operating costs, and expected food and merchandise contributions, how 
many guests a year does Thrill Park need to attract to be profitable? 
Prompt #7 (Super optional extra math problem): 
Interviewer Guidance: 
. Operating costs = $60M 
. Profit per guest = Ticket sale + food contribution + expected merchandise contribution 
. Profit per guest = $50 + $10 + $12 = $72 
. Breakeven: Operating costs = Profit per guest x minimum guests 
. Minimum guests = $60M/$72 = $5M/6 = 833k guests/yr

Thrill Park 
192 
. The director of the engagement just joined us. What is our opinion of this acquisition 
for Amusement World? 
Recommendation 
. Look for bottom line-up front recommendation (i.e., Acquire Thrill Park which is 
valued at $1B), briefly support that with walkthrough of case (i.e., based on $48M 
profit¡­), list risks, and next steps. 
. Slightly different answer if going through synergies / premium part of the case, but 
same general structure/answer.

Question 2:

Specialty Steel 
195 
Your client is a mid-sized specialty steel manufacturer with a portfolio of alloys that 
span across multiple industries. The majority of sales are in the aerospace market to 
one jet engine original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Your client's contract with this 
OEM is set to expire next week, and the OEM will be opening bidding to the public. 
The OEM has traditionally demanded a total of 180,000 tons/year from the whole 
market, but analysts expect this number to sharply rise. Our client has identified this as 
a must-win scenario and wants to know if it should change its price. 
Prompt #1: 
The candidate should come up with a framework that covers the product and the pricing strategy 
(differentiation, top-down vs. bottom-up, comparison w. competitors) 
Additional information (to be provided if asked): 
. Client's primary goal is to win the contract, secondary goal is to maximize revenue 
. Gross profit margin is over 90% 
. The OEM buys "718", a high-nickel, temperature-resistant alloy that is made in an expensive 
Vacuum Induction Melting (VIM) furnace 
¨C 718 is "specked in", meaning the product cannot be changed without a costly process to 
recertify the jet engine 
¨C There are two other suppliers of 718. We don't know what they will bid. 
. We charge $7/ton of ¡°718¡± (1 ton = 2,000 lbs) 
Interviewer Guidance:

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
Prompt the candidate to evaluate market 
competitiveness by calculating total 
Aerospace capacity 
. Key Insights: 
¨C The market already doesn't meet demand. 
When demand increases, nobody will be able 
to accommodate. 
¨C We can increase capacity 
¨C We can increase price since demand is 
higher than capacity 
. Math: 
¨C (# of Aero VIMs) * (tons/batch) * (batches/hr) 
* (hr/week) * (week/year) = annual capacity 
¨C Client: 
. (3) * (25) * (1/5) * (100) * (50) = 75,000 
¨C Steel Co: 
. (1) * (35) * (1/5) * (150) * (50) = 52,500 
¨C Metals R Us: 
. (4) * (12.5) * (1/5) * (100) * (50) = 50,000

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
Present the exhibit to the candidate. Explain 
that it is an analysis our team previously ran to 
assess capacity and demand. 
Questions: 
1. What is our client¡¯s current revenue? 
2. Why does the supply curve look like this? 
3. Our client is considering three pricing 
options (see below). Prompt the candidate 
to determine the best option to bid for the 
contract. 
A. Price at $14/lb 
B. Price at $12/lb 
C. Price at $10/lb 
4. What effect will this have on revenue? 
5. (brainstorm) If we go with option C, hence 
raising the price on a critical customer, 
what services or offerings could our client 
consider to help smooth the relationship 
with the OEM over the price increase? 
. Math: 
¨C Current Revenue = 75,000 * $7/lb = $525k 
¨C Revenue = New Quantity * New Price 
. Option 1: 75,000 * $14/lb = $1.05M 
. Option 2: 100,000 * $12/lb = $1.20M 
. Option 3: 125,000 * $10/lb = $1.25M 
¨C Revenue Increase: 
. $1.25M - $525k = +$725k 
. $725k / $525k = +138%

. When working on a team where you are not the leader, what is the typical role you 
take? 
Question 1: 
. What is your least favorite aspect of Fuqua? 
Question 2:

Goodbye Horses 
203 
. Your client is the CFO of Aperture Laboratories, a leading US biopharmaceutical company with a 
market cap >$150B. Aperture develops and manufactures a diversified range of products and in 
particular prides itself on saving millions of human lives every year. 
. The company is under investor pressure because of its slow firm value growth over the next 10 
years. Investors are very anxious to see significant changes announced at the firm in the next 
quarter. The CFO has already identified and evaluated a number of high-growth, promising, but 
capital-intensive projects, and she does not have enough cash to invest in any of the 
opportunities¡ªwhat dose she need to do next? 
Prompt #1: 
. The prompt can be ambiguous, and many interviewees may drive the case towards evaluating the projects or building a 
profit tree of the existing business to identify any issues. Neither of these approaches directly answers the prompt, but probe 
them to realize the goal is to raise capital in order to fund these projects. 
¨C Optional: this case can be a good opportunity for the interviewee to experience a free-flowing, conversational ¡°partnerstyle¡± 
case. Consider telling the interviewee to not write anything down for the framework. 
. Let the student build a framework, which should be focused on ways to raise capital, but could also include other next steps 
such as gaining management buy-in to invest in these high growth opportunities 
¨C Ideal framework will include ways to raise capital (issuing equity, raising debt, divesting a portion of business, 
canceling existing projects to free up budget) and also touch on where to deploy the capital (i.e., into the projects) 
¨C Students may discuss P&L levers in their framework, which is OK, but check to see if they realize any cost-cutting or 
revenue-boosting measures will not raise capital quickly and do not satisfy investor requirements for significant 
changes 
¨C Ideal candidate will discuss pros/cons of each way to raise capital 
. Guide them towards thinking about divestiture, then provide them with the first exhibit

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #1 
. Provide the exhibit and let the interviewee walk 
through it verbally 
. The interviewee should drive the discussion and 
determine that animal health is the best option 
to divest, providing sufficient rationale 
. If the interviewee does not choose animal 
health, discuss with them their rationale and 
steer them towards choosing animal health 
¨C The interviewee should take the hint and 
switch towards animal health 
. Do not prompt the interview towards next steps; 
make sure they drive conversation towards how 
much capital they can raise and if they can find 
buyers for the business unit 
. Chart takeaways (not all necessary to discuss) 
¨C Animal health is one of the lowest growth 
business units 
¨C Animal health is the most different business 
unit and outside of what Aperture prides 
itself in (saving human lives) 
¨C Its low degree of specialization will allow a 
larger pool of potential buyers (i.e., easier 
for another company to operate)

. Unknown to the CFO until now, the business development team has retained JP Morgan to 
assess the sale-ability of the Animal Health business. They have identified that Aperture will likely 
receive a 3.5x enterprise value to sales multiple for the animal health business. 
Prompt #2: 
. Do not prompt further; let the interviewee work through the next steps 
. The interviewee should drive towards understanding how much capital they will receive from the 
sale (($4.2B x 3.5 = $14.7B) 
¨C If asked about taxes, tell the interviewee the deal has been structured by JP Morgan to be 
tax-free 
. The interviewee should then begin discussing which projects to invest the capital in. Once they¡¯ve 
begun thinking about this, provide the next exhibit

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #2 
. Provide the exhibit and let the interviewee walk through 
it verbally 
. If asked, tell the interviewee that the NPV includes the 
capital investment 
. The interviewee should drive the discussion and 
determine which projects to invest in; an excellent 
candidate will also look to discuss qualitative aspects of 
each projects (e.g., how long each project will likely 
take) 
. Given our capital constraint of $14.7B, the interviewee 
should attempt to maximize NPV. Thus, the most 
effective use of capital is to invest in: 
¨C Acquire newly approved GLP-1 agonist 
¨C Research new formulations for existing product 
portfolio 
¨C Cost-cutting initiative in US manufacturing plants 
. At this point, tell the interviewee to summarize their 
recommendation 
¨C Recap we want to sell animal health to raise capital 
and invest in 3 projects listed above 
¨C Risks: ability to sell animal health (i.e., finding a 
buyer), timing of deal completion, etc. 
. The easiest way to identify which projects to prioritize is 
to calculate a profitability index (e.g., NPV divided by 
capital investment) 
. The interviewee can then rank projects by profitability 
index and see how many can be completed given our 
constraint of $14.7B 
. Calculations 
1. $10 / $9 = 1.11 
2. $10 / $6 = 1.67 
3. $7 / $5 = 1.40 
4. $5 / $4 = 1.25 
5. $5 / $3 = 1.67 
6. $3 / $3 = 1.00 
. Adding up projects 2, 3, and 5 gives us the highest NPV 
($22B) given our capital constraint of $14.7B from the 
sale. It only requires $14B to accomplish. 
. A very good candidate will also have a recommendation 
for the remaining $700M, i.e. share buy back, dividend 
payment, etc.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
1. Before handing the candidate Exhibit 1, 
have him/her brainstorm and list out how 
having a Liger would impact total revenue 
and potential costs associated with the 
purchase and upkeep of a Liger. 
2. Present Exhibit 1. The Candidate should be 
performing an NPV analysis. 
DO NOT LET THE CANDIDATE ROUND 
NUMBERS FOR THIS EXERCISE 
The following information can be provided only if 
requested. 
. Ticket prices will remain the same (Adults $17, Children 
$11) 
. Merchandise and shows revenue will still be 10% and 5% 
of total ticket revenue, respectively 
. Other upkeep costs consists of items such as food, 
medical, etc. Assume the Liger lives 100 years, therefore 
we can use a perpetuity 
. Liger purchase price, transportation cost, and enclosure 
construction are one-time costs (total = $4M) 
. Discount rate of 10% 
. Assume it takes one year to build the enclosure (t=0), 
revenue begins after 1 year (t=1). Perpetuity formula 
(CF/Disc Rate) is PV of cash flows in one years time. 
. Objective Target ROI of 14% 
. Of the total costs, purchase, transportation, and 
enclosure are one-time costs (Investment costs) 
¨C Total one-time costs = 1,350k + 675k, + 1,975k = $4M 
. After buying a Liger, the zoo increases visitors by 10% 
(and maintains this number indefinitely) 
. Therefore, incremental increased revenue is as follows: 
¨C 30,000 Adult tickets @17 = $510k 
¨C 30,000 Adult tickets @11 = $330k 
¨C Total Incremental ticket revenue = $840k 
¨C Incremental Merch. revenue = $840k *10% = $84k 
¨C Incremental Show revenue = $840k * 5% = $42k

. What if the zoo decides to buy two Ligers, a male and a female? Would this be a 
good idea? 
Prompt #2: 
Given the prompt, the candidate should begin to ask about procreation, increased ticket 
sales, etc. Guide the candidate until he/she asks about procreation and incremental revenue, 
then provide the following information. 
The following information can be provided if requested. 
. If the Ligers reproduce, the baby cubs can be sold 
. 90% chance the Ligers will reproduce immediately (once purchased at t=0), assume gestation 
period is 1 year. 
¨C This cub could be sold immediately (at T=1) for $1M. 
See following page for further guidance & numbers.

Interviewer Guidance (continued) : 
Additional Costs 
. Purchase of additional Liger: $1.35M 
. Transportation of additional Liger: $675k 
. Total cost of additional Liger: $2.025M 
. Total cost of two Ligers: $4M + $2.025M = $6.025M 
Additional Revenue 
. Expected value of baby Liger = [(prob. of baby) * (revenue from sale)] / Discount Factor 
¨C 90% * $1M = $900k (This is the value in T = 1) 
¨C $900k discounted by 10% = $900k / (1+0.1) = $818.1k (Guide them with the formula, once they have 
written out the formula, provide the number, this number can be rounded) 
. Total Profit = NPV Profit of a Liger + NPV Expected Value of baby Liger 
¨C NPV Profit of a Liger is on page 5 
¨C $500k + $818.1k = ~$1.32M 
Return on Investment 
. Total Profit / Total Cost = $1.32M / $6.03M = ~21.88% (Ok to round these numbers to 1.2 and 
6.0 for 20%)

. Daenerys Targaryen, the owner, is walking into the room in a few minutes. Please 
wrap up your thoughts and provide a recommendation. 
Recommendation 
. The candidate should provide a conclusion that clearly identifies the recommendation, the 
rationale behind the recommendation, and the risks associated with the strategy. An excellent 
candidate will identify that although the purchase of one Liger will result in a ROI that is below the 
target, the ROI is still greater than the current profit margins of the zoo overall. 
. Risks: 
¨C Not procreating 
¨C Life expectancy: biggest risk, significant value of the PV is driven by the assumption of perpetuity 
¨C Concurrency (other zoos¡¯ actions) 
¨C Not reaching target of incremental revenues (amount of tickets) 
. Next Steps: the zoo should also explore other revenue sources to the acquisition of the Liger to 
mitigate the risk. 
¨C Increase the price of tickets (price sensitivity analysis) 
¨C 2-part tariff (to see the Ligers) 
¨C Memberships 
¨C Rent the Ligers 
¨C Why a Liger?

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #1 
. Exhibit represents PrimeCo¡¯s revenue and 
profits (in $ million) over the past 8 years. 
. Interviewee should recognize that 
PrimeCo¡¯s profits have been declining for 
the past 3 years, even as revenue has 
continued to rise. 
. Interviewee should draw the following 
insights: 
¨C Revenue is rising steadily 
¨C Profit grew with revenue for the first 5 years, but 
has been declining for the past 3. 
¨C Profit margin has dropped significantly from nearly 
90% in 2008 to 66% in year 2015 (not important 
that the interviewee actually do the calculations, 
simply that they recognize the severity of the 
decline). 
. Interviewee should want to dig deeper 
into PrimeCo¡¯s cost structure.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #2 
. Exhibit represents PrimeCo¡¯s cost 
structure in 2012 (the last year before 
profits began declining) and 2015. 
. Interviewee should recognize that subcomponent 
#3 has increased dramatically 
as a proportion of PrimeCo¡¯s costs, while 
labor and distribution costs have shrunk. 
. If asked, interviewer can explain that a 
sub-component is an item that is 
assembled by a subcontractor (supplier) 
and sold to PrimeCo, who then uses the 
sub-component as one part of the final 
product. For example, GM, an automotive 
manufacturer may purchase already 
assembled brake pads from Callahan 
Automotive. 
. Interviewee should draw the following 
insights: 
¨C Sub-component #3 has increased dramatically as a 
proportion of PrimeCo¡¯s total costs (25% to 39%). 
¨C Manufacturing labor and distribution has both 
shrunk as a proportion of PrimeCo¡¯s costs (22% to 
14% and 14% to 11%, respectively), possibly as a 
result of increased efficiency through technology 
improvements and automation. 
. Interviewee should want to dig deeper 
into the costs of sub-component #3.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit #3 
. Exhibit contains a lot of information, and interviewee 
should carefully walk-through the data to fully 
understand it. 
. Interviewee should recognize that with the given price of 
$10.00 unit and the breakdown of that prime, the 
interviewee can derive the dollar amount of each 
component. These dollar amounts can then be 
compared to the worldwide market price for selected 
parts. 
¨C Part A $1.00 
¨C Part B $0.80 
¨C Part C: $3.33 
¨C Labor $2.68 
¨C Overhead $0.99 
¨C Profit $1.20 
. The interviewee should also recognize that SubPrime 
Co. has significantly higher overhead rates than 
competitors, which may be contributing to their lowerthan-
industry average profit margin. 
. If interviewee suggests that PrimeCo. change suppliers 
to one of the competitiors, interviewer should note that 
SubPrime Co. is located in the same city as PrimeCo.¡¯s 
headquarters, and thus PrimeCo wants to make every 
effort to keep SubPrime Co. in business. 
. Interviewee should draw the following 
insights: 
¨C Dollar amounts for each component in the 
teardown. 
¨C SubPrime Co. is significantly marking up both Parts 
A and C in their pricing of Sub-component #3, while 
giving PrimeCo. a deal on Part B. 
¨C SubPrime Co. has a significantly higher overhead 
rate than competitors, which may be contributing to 
compressed profit margins.

. Because of the close relationship between the two companies, PrimeCo wants to 
offer SubPrime Co a deal: 
¨C If SubPrime Co. can lower the unit price to $9.00/unit, PrimeCo will help SubPrime Co 
acquire Parts A, B, and C at worldwide market prices, and will share best-practices in 
manufacturing efficiency. 
. The new unit price of $9.00/unit will include Parts A, B, and C at market prices, will 
drop SubPrime Co¡¯s overhead to industry average, and will raise SubPrime Co¡¯s 
profit margin to industry average. 
. Question 1: By how much (in dollars) will SubPrime Co have to reduce labor costs 
per unit to achieve a $9.00/unit price? 
. Give the candidate a chance to work through the first problem and then give 
the second question 
. Question 2: If this decrease in price returned PrimeCo¡¯s spend on Sub-component #3 
to 2012 levels, how would this impact PrimeCo¡¯s profits? Assume no changes to 
revenue or other costs.

. 2) If this decrease in price returned PrimeCo¡¯s spend on Sub-component #3 to 2012 
levels, how would this impact PrimeCo¡¯s profits? Assume no changes to revenue or 
other costs. 
From Exhibit #1, we can find that PrimeCo¡¯s 2012 total costs were $57M. Because we 
also know that 25% of the total 2012 costs were on Sub-component #3, we can find 
that PrimeCo spent $14.25M on Sub-component #3 in 2012. If PrimeCo reduced their 
spending on Sub-component #3 from $117M to $14.25M, they would reduce costs, and 
thus increase profit, by $102.75M. 
PrimeCo¡¯s new 2015 total cost would be $197.25M, and 2015 profit would be 
$502.75M.

. In July,2011, the German government vowed to shut down all its nuclear capacity 
within 10 years. Besides that, the government¡¯s goal is to replace it with renewable 
energy, cut greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by 40% by 2020 and 80% by 2050, 
ensure renewables contribute 80% of Germany's energy by 2050, and ensure energy 
consumption drops by 20% by 2020 and by 50% by 2050 (statistics from The 
Guardian). Bremen is a city in northwestern Germany. Its population as of 2016 is 
640,000 people. Bremen is a major cultural and economic hub in the northern region 
of Germany. As a result, the city is home to a large number of multinational 
companies and manufacturing centers. Bremen was included in the federal antinuclear

Energy Supply 
First, the interviewee should realize that this question is about matching demand and supply in Bremen. Without a nuclear 
power plant, Bremen will not be able to sustain its current consumption. Supply can be estimated in MWh (per 1 year): 
* Assumption for the average energy losses per 1 mile of transmission: 0.05%. 
1.Solar farms: 
Energy losses*: 0.05%/mile * 20 miles = 1.00% 
Energy delivered: 300,000 MWh * (100% - 1%) = 297,000 MWh 
2. Natural gas power plant: 
Energy losses: 0.05%/mile * 20 miles = 1.00% 
Energy delivered: 800,000 MWh * (100% - 1.00%) = 792,000 MWh 
3. Nuclear power plant: 
Energy losses: 0.05%/mile * 80 miles = 4.00% 
Energy delivered: 900,000 MWh * (100% - 4.00 %) = 864,000 MWh 
Total supply: 1,953,000 MWh 
Energy Demand 
Second, candidate should calculate demand using households¡¯ consumption. The assumption for the average size of 
household: 4 people per household. To ease the calculations interviewee is allowed to round household consumption to 10 
kWh 
Help candidate to come up with the idea that energy use is calculated annually, and he/she needs to multiply this 
number by 365 days. 
Total household consumption = N of households * 10 kWh * 365 days

Defining consumption of other consumers in Ost District: 
Households consumption: 73,000MWh -> 20% of Total 
Business ( 20%): 73,000MWh / 20% * 20% = 73,000MWh 
Production (20%): 73,000MWh / 20% * 20% = 73,000MWh 
Social (40%): 73,000MWh / 20% * 40% = 146,000 MWh 
Total for Ost District: 73,000MWh + 73,000MWh + 73,000MWh + 146,000 MWh = 365,000 MWh

To secure 700,000 mWh* energy supply per year for Bremen, the local project team 
has identified several options. Mayor asked you to review them, define total energy 
units needed (for each source of energy), and recommend the most viable project. All 
facilities will be operated free of charge by Federal Energy Agency. The local budget 
will pay only initial investments. Energy transmission losses can be neglected.

The solution of this part relies mainly on CAPEX calculation for each of the projects. Projects timeline and revenues will be 
the same for all types of energy facilities. Federal Energy Agency will take care of operational expenses and maintenance, 
so there is no need for complete NPV calculation 
First, interviewee needs to define net capacity that can provide 700,000 mWh per year to Bremen: 700,000/8,760 ~ 80 mWh 
(actual output) 
Second, interviewee should estimate number of energy generation units for each of the projects: 
Solar farm 
Actual output of one 
PV solar panel equals: 
0.4*25%=0.1mW 
One panel produces 
0.1*8,760 =876 mWh 
per year 
You need 
700,000/876=800 
panels to reach the 
target 
CAPEX=800*0.5=$400 
M 
Wind farm offshore 
Actual output of one 
offshore turbine equals: 
8*50%=4 mW 
One turbine produces 
4*8,760= 35,040 mWh 
per year 
You need 
700,000/35,040~20 
turbines to reach the 
target 
CAPEX=20*20=$400M 
Wind farm onshore 
Actual output of one 
onshore turbine equals: 
8*25%=2 mW 
One turbine produces 
2*8,760= 17,520 mWh 
per year 
You need 
700,000/17,520~40 
turbine to reach the 
target 
CAPEX=8*40=$320M 
Gas power plant 
Actual output of plant 
equals: 200*50%=100 
mW 
Plant produces 
100*8,760= 876,000 
mWh per year 
CAPEX=1*320=$320M 
However, candidate 
should remember that 
gas plant emits CO2

What is your story for the presentation going to be? 
Recommendation 
. Onshore windfarm is the best option considering lower CAPEX of 320 M and its 
ability to meet the dual objective of meeting closing the gap between demand and 
supply while eliminating CO2 emissions. 
. Interviewee should be able to quantify the findings from the previous prompts, while 
also enumerating risks with onshore wind-farming and the opportunity cost of 
forgoing the other sources of energy. 
. Interviewee should be able to lay out a very high level implementation plan

Make Airlines Great Again 
246 
Your client, Donald Drumpf is a 70 year old bougie real estate mogul who inherited his entire wealth from his late father. Drumpf Enterprises, 
his Company, primarily operates within the real estate/hospitality industry with numerous high-end Drumpf hotels (50% of overall top line 
revenue) and golf courses located worldwide. Lately, Drumpf has seen shrinking per room profit margins for his hotel business. As the 
debatably successful businessman that he is, Donald Drumpf believes that the shrinking margins are due to increased competition from the 
recent emergence of AirBnB and other similar businesses. In order to diversify his overall portfolio of ¡°successful¡± investments, he intends to 
enter into what he calls the bedrock of the American economy, the airline industry, and ¡°Make Airlines Great Again¡± by leveraging his success in 
the hospitality industry to create an airline that offers first in class comforts. Donald Drumpf wants to enter this industry quickly and has 
identified 2 airlines to look at. He believes that either of these airlines would help increase the overall profit margin of his business. Donald 
Drumpf has hired you to help with this matter. Despite Drumpf being convinced about airlines, the partner at your firm leading this engagement 
thinks the team needs to look at the hotel business¡¯ profitability as well. 
Prompt #1: 
The candidate should realize that he/she should begin by looking at the decline in profitability in the current business 
rather than beginning with the airline business. The candidate should develop a profitability framework that addresses 
the current business revenues/costs and a new airline business.

Interviewer Guidance (continued) : 
The prompt is worded specifically to mislead the candidate and simulate a client who doesn¡¯t 
fully understand his own business and has sought other options. A consultant should look 
holistically and if he/she doesn¡¯t, he/she will listen to the client and go directly to looking at 
the Airline I/S exhibit and perform a DCF analysis to value the airline which is the wrong 
approach. However, if the candidate decides to drive the case down this pathway (airlines), 
let the client go ahead before eventually asking the candidate what he/she thinks about the 
decrease in overall profitability of the core hotel business. 
Target: No specified target, however, current hotel business profit margin is 14%.

Exhibit #1 Guidance: 
If the candidate asks for revenue and cost breakout, mention that 
we do not have an overall breakout for the entire business, 
rather we have metrics per room. Hand the candidate exhibit #1. 
The candidate should come to two conclusions based off of this 
exhibit: 
. Decreasing profit margins are due to rising costs as costs are 
increasing faster than prices 
. Drumpf hotels are priced far higher than its competitors 
(~26% higher) 
Exhibit #2 Guidance: 
Based on Exhibit #1, the candidate should ask for a breakdown 
of costs; if not, guide them towards the breakdown and then 
provide Exhibit #2. The candidate should come to two 
conclusions based off of this exhibit: 
. Decreasing profit margins are due to a rise in salaries and 
expenses 
. Drumpf hotels has a much higher salaries expense as 
compared to its competitors 
The candidate should ask about why salaries may have 
increased or for a breakdown of salaries expense from 2014- 
2016. Have him/her brainstorm some ideas and then tell them we 
don¡¯t have a breakout, however we¡¯ve gathered some metrics on 
Drumpf and its competitors and hand them Exhibit #3. 
Exhibit #1 Analysis: 
Profit growth CAGR 2012-2016: 
. (35-43)^.25-1= -5% 
Do not make the candidate do the 
math for the CAGR analysis, but ask 
If they know the formula and then 
provide the CAGR number 
If the candidate asks about elasticity, he/she will realize 
that he/she needs to know what the demand is (i.e. # of 
occupied rooms / total rooms available). Mention that it 
will be provided subsequently (exhibit 3).The calculation 
for it is explained in the exhibit #3 analysis. 
Exhibit #2 Analysis: 
Salaries expense has risen by 6% points per 100$ of room 
revenue, which is a 16.2% increase from 2014. 
Salaries expense in 2014 was ~$80, ($215 * 0.37) 
Salaries expense in 2016 was ~108, ($250 * 0.43) 
Salaries expense from Drumpf is ~8% higher per $100 of 
room revenue than its competitors.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit 3 
As mentioned previously, the 
candidate should be asking 
about the breakdown of 
salaries costs or information 
about the # of 
rooms/occupancy rate (to 
understand demand for 
elasticity). There is no data 
for the former, however hand 
the candidate Exhibit #3 and 
mention that our consultants 
have gathered some data 
regarding hotel metrics. 
There is A LOT of data here, 
the candidate should be 
looking for comparable data 
related to salaries expense 
and demand. This exhibit is 
designed to overwhelm the 
candidate with data so he/she 
can focus on the right pieces 
of data. Allow the candidate 
some time to process. 
. Hotels opened in the past 2 years: Drumpf hotels has opened 10 (25% of total hotels as of 2 years ago) 
new hotels in the past 2 years which is much higher than any other chain (1%<). This could lead to the 
need for increased staff as not all staff are efficient yet (2nd level insight). 
. Location of new hotels: Drumpf hotels are all located in high cost countries, while other locations with the 
exception of one Staroak hotel are located in lower cost labor locations (2nd level insight). 
. Avg employees per hotel ¨C This is what the candidate should key in on. We can see that Drumpf 
hotels has more employees per room than any of the other hotels. This can primarily be attributed 
to the maid service taking a lot longer than the other hotels (45 minutes as compared to 30). The 
cost saving solution should center around better training for housekeeping services to bring avg. 
service time down to 30 minutes and the laying off of excess employees (assume 0 severance). 
¨C Drumpf Hotel: 2012 (1 employee for every 6 rooms), 2015 (1 employee for every 4 rooms) 
Bilton: 1 employee for every 6 rooms (2012 & 2015) 
¨C Sparriott: 1 employee for every 6 rooms (2012 & 2015) 
¨C Staroak: ~1 employee for 7 to 6 rooms (2012 & 2015) 
. Avg time to service rooms ¨C 40 minutes in Drumpf as opposed to ~30 for other chains. Ask candidate to 
discuss why this may be the case. If he/she is able to, he/she can mention that the opening of 10 new 
hotels in the past 2 years is probably why there is an increased service time due to the lack of 
training/familiarity per employee (2nd level insight) which leads to higher avg service time (40 min). 
. Avg occupancy rate ¨C This can be used in conjunction with the total number of hotels, average 
number of hotel rooms, and the price elasticity of demand (if asked about from Exhibit 2) to 
determine a potential increase in revenue from decreasing price per room. Price elasticity of 
demand of -2.0: if prices drop by $25 (10%), then demand will increase by 20% (and vice versa). At 
the moment, rooms occupied is 70% or 21,000 rooms in total. Increasing this by 20% brings us to 
25,200 rooms @ $225 ($5.67M) vs 21,000 @ $25 ($5.25M). Multiply the difference ($420k) by 360 
days will give us $151.2M in increased revenue just from lowering the price. 
. Avg Salary per Employee ¨C Can be used to calculate potential total savings. If Drumpf is able to 
decrease employees to one every 6 rooms, this will be an average of 50 employees saved per 
hotel. 50 employees * 50 hotels = 2,500 employees. 2,500 employees * Avg salary of $40k = $100M 
in wages saved.

I/S for Tarheel Airways I/S for GTHC Airlines 

Interviewer guidance on Exhibit 4 
If the candidate decides to begin by examining the 
two different airlines, let them go down this path. 
The information provided will help the candidate 
perform a discounted cash flow valuation. If the 
candidate addresses the internal business first and 
doesn¡¯t address the airlines, challenge them as to 
why and ensure they rationalize why. 
To perform a DCF valuation, the candidate must first 
calculate Free Cash Flow which is defined as 
EBIT(1-Tax rate) + Depreciation ¨C Change in net 
working capital ¨C capital expenditures. 
Provide the following information only if asked: 
Tax Rate: 30% 
Discount rate: 12% 
Growth rate: 2% 
. Free Cash Flow for Tarheel: 
¨C EBIT = 3600 
¨C Tax = 1080 
¨C EBIT ¨C Tax = 2520 
¨C Divide FCF by (discount rate ¨C growth rate) = 2520/0.1 = 25,200 
¨C Valuation of this Company is $25,200M, or $25.2B 
. Free Cash Flow for GTHC: 
¨C EBIT = 2800 
¨C Tax = 840 
¨C EBIT ¨C Tax = 1560 
¨C EBIT ¨C Tax ¨C Capital expenditures = 1560 ¨C 100 = 1460 
¨C Divide FCF by (discount rate ¨C growth rate) = 1460/0.1 = 14,600 
¨C Valuation of this Company is $14,600M, or $14.6B 
. Metrics 
¨C Tarheel Operating Margin = 14%, Net Income Margin = 20% 
¨C GTHC Operating Margin = 8%, Net Income Margin = 26% 
There is no correct answer for which Company to purchase as buying a Company is 
not the right option. For whichever Company the candidate decides to purchase, 
ensure that they rationalize it and challenge them on it (see below for example of 
questions). Once you do, if they haven¡¯t addressed the declining profit margins from 
the core hotel business, ask them what they think about that and direct the case that 
way. 
(e.g. Can the Company afford this? This isn¡¯t even their core competency. GTHC may 
have a higher Net Income Margin, however this is primarily due to the Gain on sale of 
assets, their operating margin is small. Tarheel may have higher margins, but $25.2B is 
a lot of money. Tarheel requires an additional $5B in costs, GTHC only requires $1.5B) 
254 
Exhibit #4 Prompt: Analysis: 
Exhibit #4 Guidance: 
Tarheel Airway: This airline is similar to Southwest 
Airlines, competing on price yet providing stellar service. 
However, as they currently only fly one type of airplane, 
costs to make this airline great again are estimated to 
be $5B due to the need to lease new airplanes 
GTHC Airline: This airline is similar to Virgin America 
with stellar service and great amenities already. As a 
result, renovation costs to make this airline great again 
are only estimated to be $1.5B 
We have been provided with the income statement for 
the last fiscal year for each of these airlines.

. By how much can Drumpf increase his profits for his hotel business? Assume that hotel 
room revenue is the only revenue for his hotel business. 
Prompt #2: 
Given the prompt, the candidate should begin to calculate increase in profit by decreasing the labor force and 
decreasing the avg price per hotel room. 
Increase in profit by decreasing labor costs: # of employees * # of hotels * Avg annual salary 
. 50 employees per (see Exhibit #3 for calculation) * 50 hotels * $40k = $100M 
Increase in profit by decreasing price: New $ * new demand * 360 days ¨C Old total revenue 
. ($225 * 25,200 rooms/day (see exhibit #3 for calculations)* 360) - $1.89B = $2.0412B - $1.89B = $151.2M 
Total Hotel Revenue: Average $/room * Avg # Rooms * Occupancy rate * # of hotels * 360 days 
. $250 * 600 rooms * 70% occupancy * 50 hotels * 360 days = $1.89B 
Total potential increase in profit = $151.2M + $100M = $251.2M 
No need to ask the candidate for profit margin, but if he/she wants to calculate it, it is below. 
Increase in profit margins: previously, salaries was 43% of every $100 in room revenue (or 0.43 cents per dollar). We 
will have decreased labor costs by 33% (150 employees to 100), therefore salaries will decrease by 0.143 cents per 
dollar, a direct increase to profitability. Without decreasing prices, profitability will be 28.3% (14% + 14.3%). Therefore, 
@ a price of $250, profit will be ~$70 ($250 *28.3%) which means costs are $180. If we decrease prices (say 10%) in 
order to increase top line revenue, profit will be $45 ($225-180), or 20%, still an increase from the 14%.

. Donald Drumpf has just finished with his hair appointment at the salon and is swinging by in a few 
minutes. Please wrap up your thoughts and provide a recommendation. 
Recommendation 
. The candidate should provide a conclusion that clearly identifies the recommendation, the rationale behind the 
recommendation, and the risks associated with the strategy. An excellent candidate will identify that although the idea to 
¡°Make Airlines Great Again¡± could increase profit margins, decreasing profit margins can be addressed through other means 
(training labor to be more efficient and decreasing price of hotels) that are far less expensive and that would increase top 
line revenue. Furthermore, for a Company that has top line revenue of ~$3.8B per year, purchasing an airline for ~$15B- 
$30B is unrealistic. 
. Risks: 
¨C Internal backlash from laying off 50 employees per hotel 
¨C Decrease in customer service if employees are laid off. 
¨C By decreasing prices, competitors may respond and this could lead to a potential price war 
¨C Reputation of Drumpf hotels if prices are lowered 
¨C If airline is acquired: Financing, synergies, cultures, etc. 
. Next Steps: 
¨C Begin to identify hotels where average service time is high and understand how to make the process more efficient 
¨C Conduct a competitive analysis in order to understand what their response would be to a 10% decrease in your hotel 
prices

Mock Case: 
DevCo

Redefining Medical Device Global 
Marketing Strategy 
Business Situation 
DevCo is a global medical device manufacturer headquartered in the US with operations in more than 60 countries. The Company 
produces a range of medical devices and data management tools. They have always been a market leader and commanded premium 
pricing; however, intensified competitive pressure from lower-cost manufacturers and increased customer price sensitivity have negatively 
impacted margins and market share. 
In response to these dynamics, Aaron Rike, the Chief Marketing Officer of DevCo, repositioned a portion of the high-end product line to 
address the preferences of more cost conscious customers. He also led DevCo¡¯s efforts to acquire and develop a lower cost product line 
to expand its product range. Aaron quickly realized that while the expanded portfolio was robust, the product lines lacked differentiation 
which created customer confusion and impacted financial performance. Further, he faced organizational challenges since product 
development, marketing, and sales were managed at the product level. 
Concerned that product overlap would further erode market share and profitability, Aaron called Sally Jones, a Principal In Deloitte¡¯s 
Strategy practice and long-time advisor to him and the DevCo, to discuss his challenges. He engaged Deloitte to develop a new portfolio 
strategy and redefine the accompanying go-to-market strategy in order to position DevCo for continued market leadership and growth. 
Problem Statement (For interviewer reference only; Provide one question at a time) 
Imagine you are a Senior Consultant on Sally¡¯s team as you help DevCo understand the following¡­. 
1. What factors should DevCo consider when evaluating its product portfolio and go-to-market strategy? 
2. Deloitte analysis indicates that DevCo should rationalize its portfolio in order to reduce overlap. There are three primary product lines 
(A, B, and C). Which product line is most attractive for DevCo? (Note: Share data sheet with candidate at this point) 
3. How many units of NewPro does DevCo need to sell to be profitable? Based on this analysis and the considerations from the prior 
question, would you launch NewPro? (Note: Interviewer must provide price and cost data) 
4. What should DevCo consider when deciding to launch NewPro for Product Line B? If you were the CEO, (head of all three product 
lines), would you launch NewPro?

Prompt Questions and Responses (For interviewer reference ONLY) 
1. What factors should DevCo consider when evaluating its product portfolio and go to market strategy? 
A good answer will explore the impact of external environment and company capabilities on the product portfolio and go-to-market 
strategy. Below is a list of areas that may be addressed: 
¨C Customer Mix: What types of customers use DevCo products? What must the company provide in order to meet these different 
customer preferences (e.g., product attributes, engagement approach)? 
¨C Competition: What differentiates DevCo¡¯s products from the competition? How can this be leveraged to protect / gain market 
share? 
¨C Brand: How should DevCo position products in the market (i.e., features, price, channel) to promote the DevCo brand? 
¨C Channel: Which distribution channels should DevCo utilize? What regulatory perspectives should be taken into account? 
¨C Product: What is a customer¡¯s willingness to pay for certain product features / functionality? What products offer ¡°good enough¡± 
features to address customer preferences? 
¨C Financial Impact: How much revenue does each product line drive? Which lines are most profitable? 
A great answer looks beyond external factors and company capabilities to explore the impact of the portfolio structure and go-tomarket 
strategy on DevCo¡¯s strategy and operations both today and in the future. Below is a list of areas that may be addressed: 
¨C Strategic Priorities: How can product positioning and customer engagement be used to support DevCo¡¯s strategic priorities 
(e.g., continued market leadership, broad portfolio)? 
¨C Organization Structure: Can the current organization and structure support the future portfolio strategy? 
¨C Global Footprint: How will country-specific needs and regulations impact product requirements and go-to-market strategy? 
¨C Evolving Environment: What market trends (e.g., Health Care Reform, growth of emerging markets) are impacting customer 
preferences and how should DevCo respond?

2. Deloitte analysis indicates that DevCo should rationalize its portfolio in order to reduce overlap. There are 
three primary product lines (A, B, and C). Which product line is most attractive for DevCo? 
A good answer will provide accurate financial information to support the argument (see below). 
. The interviewee will create income statements for each product line for the most recent fiscal year (2012). Cost of 
capital should not be used in any way (extraneous information) 
. The interviewee will calculate operating income and operating margin %. 
. If the candidate focuses on largest operating income then product line B is the correct answer; however, if candidate 
focuses on operating margin % then Product Line C is correct 
. Below is the math for each product line: 
Product Line A Product Line B Product Line C

2. Deloitte analysis indicates that DevCo should rationalize its portfolio in order to reduce overlap. There are three primary 
product lines (A, B, and C). Which product line is most attractive for DevCo? 
ANSWER CONTINUED 
A great answer will calculate the income statement for three years using historic and forecast data to identify trends in operating income 
and operating margin % (operating income for 2013 can be calculated without constructing the full statement ¨C since all the costs are 
variable, operating income grows at the same rate as revenue): 
. Product line C has enjoyed the fastest top-line growth, although it remains the smallest of the three, while product line B, the largest 
one, has had the slowest growth 
. All product lines have seen operating margin declines since 2011, and stable margins in 2012-2013, with product line C having the 
highest margin. 
. As a result, Product Line C is most attractive both from the total operating income perspective and from the operating margin % 
perspective (different than the ¡°good answer¡± due to forecasting with growth) 
The candidate can also use the qualitative information to develop further inferences from the data. As long as they can strongly articulate 
the basis for the argument, this is valid. Examples include: 
¨C Support model: The candidate references the service models as being a key driver of profitability for the products 
¨C Durability: Product Line B has a product life that matches product line A, but at a lower price point. This could be a key driver in 
why gross margin is lower in product line B

3. Product Line B is considering launching a new product, NewPro, to expand its footprint within the DevCo 
portfolio. NewPro will have a suggested price of $200 with a rebate offered to all purchasers of $15 per 
product. The manufacturing cost will be $115 per unit and per product marketing costs are expected to be 
$20 per unit. The fixed costs to launch the product will be $20,000,000. Product Line leadership only wants 
to launch NewPro if it is profitable by the end of year 1. 
How many units does DevCo need to sell to be profitable? 
This answer is a straightforward calculation. The candidate needs to be able to properly build a breakeven analysis. 
There is only one correct answer to this question though a fair answer could still be obtained if the candidate sets the 
analysis up properly (i.e., shows the understanding) but makes a simple mental math error. See the math below: 
Price $ 200 
Rebate $ (15) 
Net Price $ 185 
Manufacturing costs $ 115 
Marketing $ 20 
Variable Costs $ 135 
Margin $ 50

3. Product Line B is considering launching a new product, NewPro, to expand its footprint within the DevCo portfolio. NewPro 
will have a suggested price of $200 with a rebate offered to all purchasers of $15 per product. The manufacturing cost will be 
$115 per unit and per product marketing costs are expected to be $20 per unit. The fixed costs to launch the product will be 
$20,000,000. Product Line leadership only wants to launch NewPro if it is profitable by the end of year 1. 
FOLLOW UP: Based on this analysis and the considerations from the prior question, would you launch NewPro? 
A good answer will consider the viability of selling 400,000 units in year one, in addition to the brand, selling model, and risk 
considerations discussed in the prior questions. One way to justify the viability of the volume required to breakeven is for the candidate to 
calculate the projected revenue from NewPro at break-even and to compare it with the total Product Line B revenue in 2012. Revenues 
from NewPro represent only around 3% of product line revenues, suggesting that achieving break-even in the first year is viable. 
A great answer will not only consider the viability of selling 400,000 units in year one, but also consider the potential impact to the 
broader business (e.g., capacity, resourcing) and some qualitative considerations which should be explored (i.e., branding, product 
overlap, sales model). This brings in information from the answer provided in question 1. 
The candidate can also mention that 100% rebate execution is a conservative assumption, and that, if execution percentage is lower, the 
contribution margin will be higher and less units will be required to break even. 
Finally, the candidate can discuss the positive margin implications for Product Line B, as the margin on NewPro is significantly higher than 
the average product line margin (25% from gross and 27% from net price vs. 14% average).

4. NewPro will be positioned as ¡°leading edge¡± with a high touch support model. The product will be sold 
through the third-party distributors that Product Line B utilizes. 
What should DevCo consider when deciding to launch this product? If you were the CEO (head of all three 
product lines), would you launch NewPro ? 
A good answer will use information from previous answers to raise several considerations in addition to the output of the 
breakeven analysis ¨C most information suggest that NewPro should not be launched with the current plan: 
¨C Investment priorities: Given relatively slow growth and low margins, Product Line B may not be the best place to 
spend limited investment dollars. Product Line C is most attractive (highest margin %) for DevCo, so investment 
should focus there. 
¨C Product Overlap: Product overlap has been identified as one of the key issues to be resolved, and NewPro 
introduction arguably exacerbates this problem. Being a ¡°leading edge¡± product, NewPro may not align with the 
brand, price point, and feature set of other products from Product Line B. NewPro is more similar to Product Line A, 
which could further cannibalize revenues and create customer confusion. 
¨C Support Model: Product Line B is sold through distributors with limited on site support. A higher touch support 
model, for NewPro would require additional investment from DevCo. 
A great answer will examine mitigation strategies that would allow DevCo to realize financial and strategic opportunities 
from NewPro while addressing associated risks, and highlight additional considerations, for instance: 
¨C NewPro launch as part of Product Line A ¨C the candidate should explain the fit with Product Line A and 
understand that we may need some additional info, i.e. whether the product line already has similar products. Also, 
we have to determine whether direct sales force selling Product Line A is an appropriate channel for NewPro. 
¨C Identified need for the product ¨C if current customers of Product Line B are demanding this particular product, 
then investment can be a necessity to prevent customers from switching to competitors.

PHARMACEUTICAL RARE 
DISEASE BUSINESS GROWTH

Pharmaceutical Rare Disease Business Growth 
Prompt 
Our client is a large pharmaceutical company with a strong business in "Rare Disease" (rare diseases are 
conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US). 
Historically, pharmaceutical companies have not invested significantly in Rare Disease because it has not 
been cost effective to conduct research for such small populations. Due to the fall off in the number of 
pharmaceutical blockbusters and improved regulation to make R&D cheaper for Rare Disease, 
pharmaceutical companies have begun to invest more in Rare Disease R&D over the last few years. 
Our client has hired BCG because it would like to grow its Rare Disease business. 
Interviewer Guidance 
Case question to solve 
1) How can the client double its Rare Disease business in 5 years? 
268

Interviewer Guidance 
Ask the candidate the following questions 
1) How would you approach our client's question on growing its Rare Disease business? 
2) Where would you like to start? 
When the candidate asks about the existing business, share Exhibit 1. Based on the data, how large will the client's rare 
disease business be in 2016? [If necessary,] what is the shortfall to its goal of doubling its business? 
What does the client need to do to double the Rare Disease revenues by 2016? [If candidates discusses acquisitions] ask 
who should the client acquire and how many assets will client need to buy? 
Let's say the CEO walks in, could you summarize for me? 
269 
Interviewer Guidance (Provide only if requested) 
Our client is an industry leader with a track record of success. Its existing business is $2.5B, expected to grow at 5% per 
year 
Rare disease market is $30B and is as profitable as "Big Pharma¡° 
. While research is relatively expensive, the government provides tax credits for drugs designated to treat rare diseases 
. Additionally, prices tend to be higher to make up for the upfront research investment. It's also growing faster than Big 
Pharma. 
There are many small bio-techs that are attractive targets and there are also other big pharmaceutical companies that have 
rare disease divisions / assets 
Pharmaceutical Rare Disease Business Growth

Recommendation 
Internal growth will not be sufficient to achieve your goal of doubling your business. You will need to 
acquire ~3 "peak revenue" assets to close the gap between your goal of $2.5B and the $1.1B your 
portfolio will generate organically.

Consumer Products Strategy 
Prompt 
Our client is a large, multinational consumer products company with business in over 200 countries. Today, we are going to 
focus on its US business. 
Our client has been following US demographic trends and has found that low income households have been growing two 
times as quickly as other consumer segments Low income is defined as families with income at the poverty level or below. 
Our client has always had a premium product strategy. It sells its products in grocery stores, convenience stores, mass 
retailers, etc. but its products are always priced at the high-end of their respective categories It has never targeted the low 
income segment before and doesn't have a low income strategy, but given the growth of this segment, our client is 
considering entering the low 
income segment. 
Our client has 3 questions for BCG. 
1) Should it have a low income strategy? 
2) If it should have a low income strategy, what are some tactics it should deploy? 
3) What are some of the risks the client may face? 
Interviewer Guidance 
Ask the candidate the following question 
1) What would you like to know to help the client answer its questions? 
When the candidate asks about products, share Exhibit 1. The client has shared some data for its key products. What do 
you make of this information?

Consumer Products Strategy 
Interviewer Guidance Continued 
Ask the interviewee the second question 
2) What else would you like know about diapers and cold medicine to assess the opportunity? 
Ok. The client is not interested in cold medicine, but it has done customer research that suggests low income consumers 
are interested in buying diapers. Share Exhibit 2 
What do you see that could help us figure out why low income consumers aren't buying our client's diapers? 
What else should our client think about as it develops a low income strategy? What are the risks? 
275 
Interviewer Guidance (Provide only upon request) 
. Low income consumers purchase largely in smaller, local shops 
. Low income consumers can't afford salons, but will indulge on shampoos 
. Low income consumers are willing to spend more on baby food to protect their children 
. There are valid generics that compete with our client's cold medicine

Consumer Products Strategy 
Recommendation 
The client should pursue a low income strategy, focusing on diapers, which could 
generate an additional $25M in revenue. 
To pursue low income consumers, our client should reduce its package size. Today, our client's package 
size is significantly larger than its competitors. Our client could keep the price /diaper the same, but if it 
dropped the package size from 40 diapers to 20 diapers, it would cut the absolute price of the box to $10, 
even lower than its competitors. 
There will be some risks involved with adopting a low income strategy including cannibalizing business 
from existing products and brand risk.

Surfboard Wax 
(provided by Accenture) 
280

Accenture: Surfboard Wax 
Your client, Big Island surfboards is a surfboard manufacturer based in Hawaii. The CEO wants to expand the 
company¡¯s product line and revenues and is thinking of entering the market for surfboard wax. It hired you to 
calculate the market size for wax, and your firm determined that the market size for surfboard wax is about $6m a year 
with about 3 million bars sold annually. Your firm also found that the market was fairly competitive with three large 
global players all based outside of Hawaii controlling about 70% of the market smaller niche companies including a 
few based in Hawaii accounting for the remaining 30%. 
The client was impressed with our work and believes that its unique brand and connection to Hawaii will it enable it to 
succeed in capturing a piece of the pie. It wants to move forward with entering the market and has now asked us to 
determine how they should enter the market for surfboard wax. How would you think about this problem? 
Prompt #1: 
The candidate should recognize that this is a market entry case and confirm this with the interviewer. If the candidate asks 
what surfboard wax is, you can tell them that the wax comes in a bar form (similar to soap) and is used to coat the top of the 
surfboard in order to provide surfers with a surface that their feet can grip. 
The Framework: 
A strong candidate¡¯s framework should list several options for entering the market: 1) building the capability to manufacture the 
wax by itself, 
2) acquiring another company that manufacturers wax, 3) partnering with another company in a joint venture, 4) contracting 
out production and then reselling or 5) licensing its brand to another company. The candidate will then link these options to a 
profitability tree to estimate whether the company can earn a return on its investment. 
The candidate¡¯s profitability tree should have: 
1)Price: Candidate should show that the average price obtained by calculating $6 million/3 million bars sold = $2; or some 
number around this that is justified. The candidate can also make the case that by leveraging our client¡¯s name in surfboards, 
we can command a higher price ($3 because it is brand name and can command a premium, etc.) 
Interviewer Guidance: 
281

Accenture: Surfboard Wax 
2)Quantity: A savvy candidate will recognize that quantity will hinge upon the strategy pursued. If the candidate discusses organic growth 
within the framework, the candidate should recognize that this is likely a competitive market and estimate a reasonable market share that 
company can obtain. Reasonable estimates range from 5%-15% which translates into 150,000 to 450,000 bars sold. (Note: calculations do 
not need to be in the framework; this is guidance to measure how a candidate might think about this.) 
3)Variable costs: Candidate should list out some of the components of variable cost such as materials (wax, scent, etc.) (Note: Candidate is 
not expected to know materials in wax but a strong candidate will list a few to demonstrate that he/she is thinking about how to calculate 
costs), packaging and shipping costs. In the case of a contract arrangement, it is assumed that variable costs are absorbed by the contractor 
who will then charge the company a price per unit. 
4)Fixed costs: Candidate should some costs such as rent, labor, SG&A, and marketing costs in order to generate sales. (Note: the 
candidate should not list ¡°costs¡± related to any of the options such as acquiring PPE or another company as these are fixed assets rather 
than fixed costs.) 
After the candidate has reviewed their framework with you, ask them to discuss qualitatively the potential up and downside of each of the 
options. If the candidate is missing more than two of these options, push the candidate to think about additional market entry strategies 
before you begin this discussion. It is critical that they identify at the very least, acquiring another company and contracting out production. If 
they are unable to come up with both of these scenarios, you can offer it to them as a suggestion. 
A strong candidate will be able to succinctly articulate the costs and potential rewards associated with each option and drive the client 
towards exploring an option with a hypothesis lead approach. An example might look something like: ¡°Option 1 would involve significant 
investment in R&D and manufacturing capabilities but could earn the company the greatest return, Option 2 would be costly and logistically 
complicated but gives the company access to an established product line and distribution channels, Option 3 would spread cost and risk to 
two companies but would tie the company up with a partner in a potentially costly and complicated venture, Option 4 would enable quick 
production but would open up the company to risk should its contractor be unable or unwilling to meet demand in the future and Option 5 
would provide the company with a steady revenue stream but place control of its brand into another company¡¯s hands. Based upon my 
reading of the data, I recommend that we start with Option 5 as it seems to be the lowest risk 
After the candidate has discussed the pros and cons of each option, go to the next prompt. 
Interviewer Guidance: 
282

Accenture: Surfboard Wax 
Upon reviewing the options, the client decides that organic growth and a joint venture is too 
complicated and doesn¡¯t feel comfortable taking the risk associated with building such capabilities. 
Additionally, the client doesn¡¯t¡¯ feel comfortable licensing out its brand name because it wants 
control over how the product is marketed and sold. The CEO is interested in either acquiring a 
company or contracting out production. It has identified a candidate for each of these and wants us 
to perform some due diligence on whether it can earn a return on its investment within 5 years. The 
candidate doesn¡¯t need to worry about discounting. 
Acquisition: 
Information to be shared with the candidate: The company it wants to acquire, Aloha Surf Wax 
sells its bars for $2.50 a piece to retailers who then retail it for $3. Its cost of goods sold is $.50 
and annual fixed costs for things like marketing, sales, SG&A is $300,000 a year. The company¡¯s 
product is popular and it has 10% of the total market in Hawaii. The owner wants to sell the 
company and has set a firm price of $1 million. 
Prompt #2: 
The candidate should calculate: 
Annual revenue: $750k (10% x 3m x $2.50) 
COGS: $150k (10% x 3m x$.50) SG&A: $300k 
Total Annual Profit: $300k 
After 5 years, the company would earn $300k x 5 = $1.5 m - $1m price = $500k 
Interviewer Guidance: 
283

Accenture: Surfboard Wax 
Contracting Out Production: 
The client has identified another wax manufacturer, Maui Surf Wax, that has agreed to use its 
excess capacity to produce 300k bars a year. Maui wax will charge our client, $1.50 a bar. Our client 
projects that it can then sell to its retailers for $3.00 a bar and sell out of its entire inventory. Maui 
wax will also charge our client a one time fee of $100k to reconfigure its equipment to produce our 
clients packaging and reformulate its wax to our clients specifications. Additionally, annual fixed 
costs for things like marketing, sales, SG&A is $300,000 a year. 
Prompt #3: 
The candidate should calculate: 
Revenue: 300k x $3.00 
= $900k COGS: 300k x 
$1.50 = $450k SG&A: 
$300k 
Total Annual Profit: $150k 
After 5 years, the company would earn $150k x 5 
-$100k = $650k 
Interviewer Guidance: 
284

Accenture: Surfboard Wax 
After the candidate has finished his/her calculations, prompt them to provide a recommendation to the CEO. 
Recommendation 
A strong candidate will start with the recommendation, support with analysis and end with next steps. 
An example of this might look something like: 
I recommend that Big Island Surfboards enter the market for surfboards by contracting production of wax 
out to Maui Surf Wax and reselling the product under Big Island Surfboards¡¯ brand. By doing so, Big Island 
Surfboards would earn a $650k return on its initial investment of 
$100k after 5 years. This would enable Big Island Surfboards to quickly enter the market and ramp up 
production. Some risks of this approach include Maui Surf wax reducing excess capacity devoted to 
production of Big Island Surfboard wax in the future or having quality control issues with production. 
As the next step, I would recommend that we conduct due diligence on other potential targets to see if we 
can get an even better deal or 
explore some of the other options that the CEO had initially ruled out.

Accenture: Mobilizing Your World 
Your client, Phone Com is a telecommunications company. The company has high brand recognition only in 
the United States and has grown primarily through a series of acquisitions over the last thirty years. Less 
than a month ago, the CEO announced another acquisition of a large satellite television company. The 
target company, Sat-Light Inc., is stable but slow growing . In order to make this merger valuable, the CEO 
has asked your team to identify 1) synergies from the merger, 2) ideas for differentiated product offerings 
and 3) opportunities for new growth. 
Prompt #1: 
The candidate should ask immediately what products are currently offered by both companies. Note: Prior to the Sat-Light 
offers television and broadband through a third party. Phone Com offers mobility, broadband and television. 
A strong candidate may also ask if we are just focused on the US. You should answer that we are focused on North and South 
America and Phone Com. has limited distribution in South America and Sat-Light has new distribution in South America. 
The Framework: 
The first level of framework is simple. It should be separated into the three different areas outlined in the prompt. A good 
candidate¡¯s framework will not include anything about profitability. The framework should indicate a strong understanding of the 
industry through answers given. 
For synergies acceptable answers are as follows (note I have highlighted if they are easy, medium or hard conclusions after 
each item in parentheses); personnel (easy), content (hard), supply chain (medium), ad sales (hard), IT systems (easy), 
bundling (easy) & collections (hard). A strong candidate will have highlighted that synergies are both cost reduction and 
revenue building and provide some examples for each itemlisted.

Accenture: Mobilizing Your World 
For differentiated product, this is an opportunity for candidates to demonstrate their brainstorming under 
pressure. A strong candidate will offer at least three ideas but he/she is unable to, you can guide them by 
suggesting a few ideas such as a television everywhere enhancement or an app the that streams DVR¡¯d 
content to your phone. Note: there is no wrong answer for this section. 
For growth strategy a good candidate should include some initial suggestions: 
1) South America distribution 
2) Bundling 
3) Channel optimization (new distribution within US) 
4) Other commercial opportunities 
Interviewer Guidance:

Accenture: Mobilizing Your World 
Based upon your initial brainstorm, the CEO wants to focus on television and what the opportunity for 
expansion is. That is, he wants to know of any households not currently being served by Phone Com, Sat- 
Light, or its competitors. His office has provided you with the following data: Sat-Light serves 30 million US 
households and Phone Com serves 10 million US households. Sat-Light has a national footprint while 
Phone Com is only available in certain area due to infrastructure restrictions. The industry has two other 
big competitors and one smaller competitor. The first competitor serves15 million US households, the 
second competitor serves 32 million US households and the third competitor serves 7 million US 
households. All of the customers are unique and do not overlap among the companies. 
Prompt #2: 
A strong candidate should be able to do a fairly quick market sizing: 
~320 individuals in the US 
~3 individuals per household 
=~107 households. 107 ¨C (10+30+15+32+7) = 13 million households. 
The candidate should realize the US industry is extremely saturated. The additional number of 
households may be cord cutters, unable to access TV for a number of technology reasons or also unable 
to afford TV. Therefore, opportunity for growth is extremely limited. 
Interviewer Guidance: 
289

Accenture: Mobilizing Your World 
After presenting the findings of your analysis and that opportunity for expansion of television is limited in the 
U.S., the CEO wants to know of other growth opportunities. The CEO wants to review your initial 
suggestions in your framework for growth strategy and wants you to discuss opportunities and risks to 
associated with each of those growth opportunities. 
Prompt #3: 
Few examples include: 
1)South America Expansion ¨C It is a completely segmented market with a lot of opportunity. Risks/Things 
to Think About: corrupt government, each country operates differently, technology capabilities are far 
behind the US and limited current infrastructure (aka a lot of investment). 
2)Bundles ¨C With a new reduced pricing structure and one combined bill, customers will be interested in a 
bundle. Risks/Things to Think About: Differentiate the bundle from competitors, IT upgrades to develop 
combined bill, installation infrastructure (are the same techs able to install two different products). 
3)Commercial ¨C It is important for a candidate to realize the households are only a portion of the market. 
There is an opportunity to sell to businesses. Risks/Things to Think About: Sales Strategy, Resources 
Needed, Differentiated Product for Commercial, Differentiated Pricing Package for Commercial 
Interviewer Guidance: 
290

Accenture: Mobilizing Your World 
After discussing growth strategy, the CEO wants you to provide an overall summary and recommendation. 
Recommendation 
A strong candidate will start with the recommendation, support with analysis and end with next steps. 
An example of this might look something like: 
¡°At the CEO¡¯s request, we¡¯ve identified the potential synergies, a new differentiated product and 
opportunities for growth. The strongest potential cost optimization synergies are personnel reductions, 
supply chain, IT systems and content contracts, however, it is important to note there are revenue 
generating synergies as well such as advertising sales. The differentiated product we recommend is XXXX 
as it optimizes the combination between mobility and televisions. We also realized after reviewing the case 
in more detail that there is limited growth opportunity to expand in the US, however, we recommend the 
new company look into opportunities in South America and commercial sales. Before moving forward, we 
recommend 1) a deeper understanding of current technology related to mobility and television in South 
America & 2) more information on market share in the commercial segment.

Earth. Scientists at NASA have determined that there is a 10 percent probability that 
this asteroid makes landfall. If it hits, the asteroid will create a large dust storm 
blocking out sunlight and preventing photosynthesis in plants. This will ultimately 
destroy the rest of the earth¡¯s ecosystem for the next 100 years. NASA needs help 
determining whether they should launch the Eternity Mission, a space exploration 
mission to find a suitable planet for the human population to live on in the event of 
the catastrophic asteroid impact. 
Prompt #1: 
Additional information to be provided to the candidate if requested: 
. NASA¡¯s goal is to safely evacuate at least 20% of the world¡¯s population in the event 
of impact. 
. The Asteroid would hit earth in 25 years. NASA estimates it will require 15 years to 
build enough space vehicles and safely evacuate 20% of the world¡¯s population. 
Therefore, Mission Eternity needs to be completed within 10 years.

(continued) 
. Assume NASA has had major breakthroughs in space travel and spacecraft can now 
travel at the speed of light. 
. Other international space agencies are looking to NASA to make a decision. Their 
budgets are unavailable to aid this mission. 
. NASA has already weighed other options to salvage the earth¡¯s population, such as 
hitting the asteroid to break it into smaller pieces, and determined that is not possible. 
Additionally, other efforts to live underground are being researched separately. 
. Cost of the Eternity Mission will vary by planet(s) selected for exploration, we do not 
have specific figures. 
. Assume NASA has figured out a way to use therapeutic hypothermia hibernation to 
enable humans to travel very long distance in space.

Interviewer Guidance: Potential Framework

Mission Eternity 
If not already provided to the candidate, inform them that the asteroid is set to hit earth 
in 25 years. At least 15 years is needed to build enough space vehicles and to safely 
evacuate 20% of the world¡¯s population. Therefore, Mission Eternity can only take 10 
years from start to finish. 
Additionally, NASA¡¯s Eternity spacecraft can travel at the speed of light. 
The closest four potentially habitable planets are Planet W, Planet X, Planet Y, and 
Planet Z. Once the Eternity spacecraft arrives to a planet, it will take on average 18 
earth months to collect data sufficient to determine if the planet can support human life. 
NASA has also discovered a way to send signals carrying the data back to earth faster 
than the speed of light. It will take three months per light year in distance for signals to 
reach earth. [Assume one month is 30 days.]

Interviewer Guidance on Exhibit #1 
. The candidate should realize that distance is related to timing and will impact the 
decision to explore certain planets within the allotted 10 year timeframe. The 
candidate should convert distances in Exhibit 1 into light years and add the additional 
time for data collection and receipt of the data signal to determine the total time it will 
take to make a decision about whether a planet is suitable for human life. 
. Candidate should determine that Planet W will not return information in time for NASA 
to build evacuation spacecraft, and therefore should be eliminated from consideration. 
. Candidate should drive the case and ask for additional metrics regarding water, 
atmospheric conditions, etc. to determine which planet would be most suitable to 
sustain life.

Interviewer Guidance on Exhibit #2 
. Candidate should drive case and focus on 
prioritizing one or two key metrics and ask 
for available data, then provide Exhibit 2. 
. NASA only has the manpower and 
financial resources to visit one planet. 
Prior robot missions returned the following 
results. 
. In astronomy, the habitable zone is the 
region around a star within which 
planetary-mass objects with sufficient 
atmospheric pressure can support liquid 
water at their surfaces. In other words, 
this indicates the likelihood of water. 
. Earth Similarity Index, ESI, is a measure 
of how physically similar a planetary-mass 
object is to Earth. It is a scale from zero to 
one, with Earth having a value of one. 
. The candidate should determine that 
Planet Y has the best indicators for 
supporting human life. 
. Additionally, NASA¡¯s goal is to safely 
evacuate at least 20% of the world¡¯s 
population in the event of impact. Planet 
Y provides the best option for safely 
sustaining life.

before the 10 year deadline and has the highest indicators to sustain human life ¨C 
with an ESI of 0.8 and a location in the 80th percentile of a habitable zone. 
. Risks: Planet Y is the furthest away from earth, making the trip and hibernation 
riskier. It is also more costly, and a higher proportion of NASA¡¯s annual budget. 
. Next steps: Prepare the mission to Planet Y, and (depending on costs) consider 
launching another mission to Planet Z since it would still return data in enough time.

. It is 2012 and your client is one of the largest retailer of oil products in the country of 
Georgia (Eastern Europe). Company is exploring the idea to build crude oil refinery in 
Georgia and has hired you to evaluate the idea. 
. The goal of the company is to understand what the capacity of refinery should be and 
wants to make go/no go decision. 
Prompt #1: 
Here is some background information that interviewee might ask about: 
. Company controls roughly 25% of all oil product sales in Georgia. 
. Currently there are no crude refineries in Georgia. All of the refined oil products are imported from 
other countries. 
. For the simplicity, consider three major oil products for this case: Gasoline, Diesel and Other Oil 
Products. 
. Georgia produces 100 000 tons of crude oil annually and this number is projected to stay stable. 
All this crude is exported to foreign countries. 
. The possibility of importing crude oil from neighboring countries is limited. Importing from 
countries further is associated with high transportation costs. 
. Oil refinery is the plant where input is crude oil and output is the final products ready for retail 
consumption like gasoline, diesel and etc.

Good framework should identify it as a investment case and would cover both Quantitative and 
Qualitative aspects of it: 
Quantitative: Candidate should identify key variables needed for evaluating the projects: Revenue 
and Fixed and Variable costs. 
Qualitative: Candidate should mention that there are multiple factors to be taken into consideration: 
availability of raw materials, demand on market, price fluctuations and other risks. 
Interviewer Guidance on Framework:

Refinery in the Country of Georgia 
307 
As a first step, your client wants to identify what should refinery¡¯s capacity be. 
Traditionally, oil refineries have very high capacities but recent technological advances 
allow to build small size refineries with the same efficiency at the same cost levels. 
Note: Hand exhibit 1 to interviewee. 
Prompt #2: 
. From the exhibit interviewee should be able to identify that there is no 
opportunity to import additional raw material and the capacity should be 
around 100 000 tons. 
. Candidate should notice that 100 000 tons is roughly 10% of current 
consumption and due to high transportation prices there would be enough 
demand on local production. 
. If needed give hints to push candidate towards this answer. 
. If needed push the candidate towards next step ¨C financial projections.

Walter Black Industries 
318 
. Your client is Walter Black Industries, a privately owned chemical manufacturing 
company based in Albuquerque, New Mexico that specializes in producing car wash 
chemicals. The client has two major products, Car Wash A and Truck Wash A. After 
a series of aggressive acquisitions 5 years ago, the client has become a market 
leader, but revenue growth has become stagnant in the last 2 years. The client would 
like us to identify opportunities to increase revenue by 30% without reducing profit 
margins. 
Prompt #1: 
Given the prompt, the candidate should focus on revenue first and cost only if it lowers 
profit margins. The candidate should develop a MECE framework that considers the 
different drivers of revenue and brainstorm case specific ideas in growing revenue. 
The following information can be provided only if requested. 
. The client made $1B (60% from Car Wash A. 40% from Truck Wash A) in revenue 
last year with a profit margin of 40%. The client would like to keep overall profit 
margins across all products at or above 40% 
. The client only sells chemicals. The customer pays for all distribution and packaging 
costs 
Additional client information is available on the following page. 
Interviewer Guidance:

Walter Black Industries 
319 
Provide the additional information only if requested: 
Industry 
. The car and truck wash chemicals industry has been growing by 2% on average over 
the last 10 years. It is difficult for both the customer and end customer of the product 
to differentiate between product quality. 
Client 
. The client currently has no new products in the pipeline. Formulations for new 
products take 5 years to develop and have a high chance to failure (85%). 
. The client only sells to chemical wholesale distributors. The client sells to the top 5 
wholesale distributors who control 95% of the global market share. 
Competitive Dynamics 
. Capital costs are high and there are no concerns over new market entrants. 
. There are three main competitors for the client. Along with the client, these four 
companies control 90% of the entire market. 
. No potential acquisition targets are available. 
Once the candidate begins asking questions regarding market share and/or 
competitors, provide Exhibit 1 and go to Prompt #2.

Interviewer guidance on Exhibits 
The team has performed a competitive 
analysis for the client¡¯s products and 
reviewed the company¡¯s financial 
performance against its top three 
competitors. What are some insights you 
can derive from this data? 
. The cost component of the exhibit is 
meant to distract the candidate to think 
about cost reduction instead of revenue 
growth. If the candidate goes off track, tell 
them that costs are similar among 
competitors and guide the candidate into 
thinking about other aspects that impact 
profit margin beyond the product cost 
. Because the graphs reflects revenue, only 
the dollar market share can be derived 
from the charts, not unit market share 
Potential Insights: 
. The client has a 20% market share in the 
car wash category and has significantly 
higher margins than its competitors. The 
competitor with the highest total revenue 
also has the lowest margins 
. The client has a 20% market share of the 
truck wash category has significantly 
lower margins than its competitors. 
. The revenue potential in the car wash 
industry is roughly 50% larger the size of 
the truck wash industry

Walter Black Industries 
The client agrees that they need to re-examine their pricing strategy and provided us with 
the following information: 
Provide the following information to the candidate 
. The client only sells chemicals on a $/gal basis. The customer provides 200 gallon totes 
for the client to fill with the product and pays for all distribution/packaging costs 
. The client¡¯s customers prefer simplicity, and the client can only change $/gal prices in $1 
increments 
. Market analysis has been performed regarding the elasticity of demand from customers 
(The candidate can assume a linear correlation) 
¨C Car Wash A: $1 change in price per gallon changes demand by 50,000 totes 
¨C Truck Wash A: $1 change in price per gallon changes demand by 100,000 totes 
Based on this information, the client would like you to make a recommendation on an 
optimal pricing strategy. 
323 
Prompt #3:

Walter Black Industries 
There are multiple ways to approach calculating the optimal price. The candidate will need 
to do the following in order to identify the optimal pricing strategy: 
1. Identify the optimal pricing strategy given the information provided 
2. Determine if the strategy meets the conditions of increasing revenues by 30% without 
reducing profit margins below 40%. 
Identifying the optimal pricing strategy: The candidate can approach this in many 
ways. Below are two approaches to calculating the best values 
Table Approach 
The candidate creates a table with price and quantity to calculate the revenue 
opportunities for each combination. Since demand has a linear relationship with supply, 
the candidate should stop moving ¡°up¡± or ¡°down¡± the table as soon as they hit a revenue 
amount that is lower than the original value or the value calculated before it. 
The following page shows some potential tables the candidate may build to perform this 
calculation. The candidate will also need to remember to multiple the price by 200 since 
the quantity is in 200 gallon totes. 
324

Walter Black Industries 
Formula Approach 
The candidate can also use a formula and derivatives to determine to optimal price for 
each product. First, the candidate must identify the relationship between the price and 
quantity of each product. Then, the candidate can substitute the quantity variable with 
price in the revenue equation (revenue = price x quantity) and find the derivative of that 
function to determine the optimal price. 
P = Price Q = Quantity R = Revenue 
The appropriate conclusion is for the candidate to identify that the optimal pricing strategy 
would be to decrease Car Wash A¡¯s price to $8, and increase Truck Wash A¡¯s price to $6. 
This will yield a revenue increase of $360M.

Walter Black Industries 
Determine of the strategy meets the conditions: The candidate must now identify 
whether or not the conditions of 20% revenue growth and stable profit margins are met. 
New Revenue / Old Revenue = $1,360(M) / $1,000(M) = 136% > 130%. 
The candidate will then need to calculate the profit under the new pricing model. 
Total: $780M Profit / Revenue = $780(M) / $1,360(M) = ~57% 
Once the candidate identifies that the goals are met through this pricing strategy, go to the 
recommendation prompt. 
Note that there are multiple solutions to this problem as long as the candidate identifies 
one that increases revenue by at least $300M and maintains 40% profitability. The 
simplest answer, which is still a viable answer, is to increase the price of Truck Wash A to 
$5, $6, or $7.

The CEO of Walter Black Industries is walking in the door and is interested in your 
findings. 
Recommendation 
The candidate should provide a conclusion that clearly identifies the recommendation, 
along with the risks associated with the strategy. An excellent candidate will not 
summarize the process in which the conclusion was reached, but rather focus on the 
impact and next steps of the recommended pricing strategy. 
Potential Risks 
. How competitors will react (price war) 
. How lowering the price of the car wash will affect brand perception 
Potential Next Steps 
. Coordinate with sales team to implement new pricing with customers 
. Perform additional analysis on customers to see if segmenting pricing for different 
customers can improve revenues even more

major change in the company. The investor benefits when equity prices rise significantly or 
dividends are paid. 
Initial Prompt 
Guide the candidate through the case. Provide the additional information if requested: 
. Large business in North America. The client operates in ~70 countries. 
. Revenue: Snacks $19B, Beauty $31B, Home $29B; EBITDA: $24B - Target Savings: $10B 
. This investor likely has influence on the board and cannot be ignored. 
Interviewer Guidance ¨C Initial Prompt Q&A 
This case challenges the candidate to think from an investor and company perspective, then 
balance the short-term and long-term objectives. Success requires the candidate to correctly 
evaluate the financial options and give a recommendation that is operationally realistic. 
Case Guidance

Activist Action 
331 
This case is meant to have interviewer guidance. Provide little guidance for advanced 
candidates. 
An activist investor is looking for an increase in stock price, and the client is 
looking for this plus long-term success. Frameworks should incorporate some of 
the following: 
Short-term Value 
. Sell a business unit (split off a whole business, brand, or geography) 
. Cost save (delayer company, shut-down plants) 
Long-term Value 
. Restructure product supply, move to low-cost countries 
Allow the candidate to drive the case and explore. Award bonus points for strong 
options that may create shareholder value. Make sure the candidate understands what 
an activist investor is targeting and the likely time horizon (1-2 years). 
It is important to acknowledge that the activist may want short-term actions that the 
company would disagree with due to long-term repercussions. 
Interviewer Guidance: Framework

332 
The partner on this case talked to the product supply (manufacturing) contact at the 
client who provided a supply chain restructuring opportunity. Do you think this is a 
viable option to satisfy the activist investor and the client? (provide Exhibit #1) 
Prompt #1 ¨C Supply Chain Restructuring 
The candidate should realize that a NPV calculation is necessary but should 
approximate using the graph. NPV calculation is below as a reference. 
A strong candidate will realize the savings are too far out for an activist investor. 
Regardless of the NPV, this project should be secondary to a short-term strategy. 
Once this option is deemed insufficient read Prompt 2.

The client mentioned that other companies have successfully used low cost sourcing. 
The example companies effectively moved or rehired functions from developed regions 
to countries like India, China, or Brazil. Do you think the options in Exhibit 2 can meet 
the client¡¯s needs for the snacks business? 
Prompt #2 ¨C Low Cost Countries 
The low cost options are unlikely to meet the client needs because it threatens longterm 
operation. This prompt is meant to test the candidates ability to structure openended 
questions (a common part of final round interviews with partners). 
Strong candidates should realize these are poor solutions. Guide the candidate as 
necessary and move to prompt #3 when candidate realizes other savings are needed. 
Interviewer Guidance ¨C Prompt #2 and Exhibit #2 
Area ($B) Suggested Solution 
Marketing 8.2 Unlikely: Marketing and R&D are necessary for innovation. It is 
difficult to find top talent in developing countries. Also, the client 
R&D 12.3 has a large North America based business. 
Manufacturing 21.7 
Not Feasible: CPG snack products are inefficient to ship long 
distances usually. Outsourcing could hurt trust in brand. 
Additionally, we just saw a major manufacturing project would take 
too long. 
Sales 3.6 Not Feasible: Low savings and managers must meet key 
customers in developed countries (Walmart, Target, Kroger, etc.)

Other companies have seen significant cash and stock price increases when splitting 
off non-core businesses. The client would like you to value these brands/businesses 
and consider divesting them. Is there any additional information needed to estimate the 
market value? 
Prompt #3 ¨C Sell Businesses 
When asked provide: Benchmarking comparable firms gives FV/EBITDA = 3.5 
A strong candidate will realize that a multiple is needed to find a sale price for each 
brand or region. If the candidate proposes using C/(r-g), give them the multiple to use 
instead. 
Silky Sweets is the best choice since it meets the target cash value to return to 
shareholders and has low growth over the past 5 years.

Strong recommendations include the following items or similar reasoning: 
The client should prepare to divest the ¡°Silky Sweets¡± brand 
. The $10.8B savings will meet the activist goals 
. This strategy does not compromise long-term operations of other brands 
. The client should court the activist investor and attempt to align long-term goals 
Additional recommendations and risks 
. Long-term product supply restructuring could benefit the client 
. Delayering (layoffs) could be appropriate in some parts of the company but would 
need evaluation

Prompt 
Your client is a rich financier who has decided recently to the capital markets as a market maker. Market makers make % commissions 
off of transactions in capital markets, and are necessary to provide liquidity and orderly market action. The year is 2014 and he 
believes that we have recovered long enough from the financial collapse to warrant an investment in this sector. There are multiple 
opportunities in the financial market and you have been hired to advise him on how and where to invest his money. He is considering 
entry into one of four markets: Commodities, Options, Equities, and Fixed Income. 
Interviewer Guidance 
This case is designed to see if a candidate can perform an analysis of market segments and determine a profitable entry point into 
an established market. This is a two-part analysis. 
Facts (to be provided if asked)- 
. Amount to be invested: up to $2.5 billion. 
. Client has experience in finance, but not in trading 
. Investment to be focused inside of United States 
. Goal is to have a positive NPV investment. Limited to only one investment (he feels his attention can only be focused on one 
opportunity at a time) 
. Size and market shares of four markets to be provided upon asking 
. Market makers make a fixed % commission on each transaction, so more volume and bigger $ value of transactions is usually better. 
These markets each intrinsically have different commission rates (which we don¡¯t have). 
Candidate should be handed Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 after he has walked through the structure of the problem and finished asking 
questions. He should perform an analysis of market attractiveness with this data. 
Behavioral Questions 
. What is one situation you have been in where you had to lead upwards (be a leader when you didn¡¯t have the authority)? 
. How would you deal with a team environment where you did not feel welcome?

Guidance 
Candidate should perform an NPV analysis based on the data provided. 
Prompt 
Our analysts have done some research on the costs of entry and expected profits from entering these markets. Please look at their 
analysis in Exhibit 3 and tell me what you can extract from these findings. 
343 
Interviewer Guidance 
Exhibit 1: Candidate should be able to conclude from the two charts that total asset value and number of transactions suggest options 
and commodities are the most attractive markets to enter. However, none of these charts show actual profit earned in the four 
markets, so more information is necessary (what are the levels of commissions?). 
Exhibit 2: From this exhibit, commodities and equities seem the most attractive for an entrant, since there are fewer major players in 
commodities and there is a major player exit in equities. Again, actual profit from entry is not apparent.

Analysis 
Market attractiveness: 
Initial analysis should show commodities and options to be most attractive in terms of market size, with commodities as the most 
attractive due to the lack of major players to inhibit entry. Both Options and Fixed Income seem to be markets where a few players 
dominate, making potential entry very difficult. Equities is interesting because of potential for cheap entry due to the liquidation of a 
major player¡¯s assets, so further analysis is necessary 
Valuation: 
Based on NPV analysis, equities are the investment to make due to the cheap entry cost. This carries an added benefit of leaving $1 
billion free for other uses. Candidate can include this excess sum in calculation, but that isn¡¯t necessary. 
Recommendation 
Recommendation should be to invest in equities. Ask candidate to give a recommendation to a the actual investor (¡°he is about to 
come into the room,¡± etc¡­) 
Next steps may include: ascertain process for buying liquidated assets, determine if there are other buyers, look at other passive 
investments for excess funds. 
Potential risks: regulatory delays, volume of equities market is low, market at all time highs and crash could mean future profit 
projections are off 
Next steps and risks are open ended and don¡¯t have to be these suggested options. Make sure candidate has thought out logical points 
and can explain his reasoning.

Performance Evaluation 
. Initial problem solving: 
Distinctive - Well-structured problem solving that is MECE and covers major factors to be considered. This is very open-ended 
so there are no ¡°musts¡±, but candidate should quickly realize this is an investment/market entry problem and approach 
it as such. 
Very strong - Structured analysis that covers many aspects, but may not be fully MECE. Candidate might need some guidance 
to ask for right information. 
Strong - Analysis covers many factors and is thoughtful. Needs some guidance to direct candidate towards data and 
crux of problem. 
Needs improvement - Analysis is fragmented. Candidate unable to structure problem and needs a lot of guidance to proceed. 
. Exhibit 1&2 - market analysis: 
Distinctive - Candidate quickly grasps what the three charts are trying to say and comes to conclusions quickly. Realizes that 
there is some possibly conflicting information and asks for data (potentially asks to do NPV). 
Very strong - Candidate comes to solid conclusions from the charts and is ready to proceed. May need prompting before 
next step. 
Strong - Candidate can handle multiple tables but may struggle to fully realize the conflicts embedded in the data. Might try to 
end case here. Needs some prompting to proceed. 
Needs improvement - Analysis is fragmented. Candidate cannot handle the multiple charts and needs a lot of 
guidance to proceed.

candidate understands most of data is superfluous and calculates from Operating Profit and Depreciation numbers only. 
Very strong - Candidate performs calculations in a timely manner. May make some mistakes. 
Strong - Candidate takes a bit of time to perform calculations. May need some guidance on where to start. 
Needs improvement - Candidate does not understand what an NPV is. May try a breakeven analysis or other kind of 
calculation. Interviewer needs to cut calculations short to get to recommendation.

Orange Yoga Studio 
Prompt 
Your client is Yoga Jones, the owner of Orange Yoga Studio. Orange Yoga is a very popular, up-scale yoga studio in New York City known 
for high quality instruction and a relaxed vibe. Yoga Jones has owned and operated Orange Yoga for the past 5 years. For its first four 
years, Orange Yoga was very financially successful; however in the past year, Yoga Jones noticed that her profits seem to be declining. 
She doesn¡¯t keep very good financial records and has made a few big investments lately, so is having a hard time figuring out a) 
whether she is actually losing profit and b) how to fix her financial woes. 
How do you help Yoga Jones? 
Interviewer Guidance 
Note: This case requires extensive guidance by the interviewer. Make sure to review carefully before giving. 
Provide the following background information upon request, or to help provide clarity after the initial framework 
. Orange Yoga offers 5 classes daily on weekdays. On weekends, they offer 4 classes. All of of their classes are ¡°Vinyasa Flow¡± style 
. Orange Yoga clients pay on a per-class basis. There are currently no ¡°package¡± deals or membership rates. 
. The competitive landscape for yoga studios in NYC has remained unchanged over the past three years. 
. Yoga Jones¡¯ recent investments were major maintenance upgrades for her studio (installing hardwood floors, fresh paint, and new 
shower facilities). These investments were financed primarily through loans. 
350

Orange Yoga Studio 
Analysis 
The candidate should quickly get to a ¦Ğ = Revenue-Cost framework. Framework considerations may include: 
. Revenue: Price per class, number of clients per class, potential other sources of revenue (i.e. yoga mats, water bottles, etc.) 
. Cost: Rent, insurance, instructors, utilities, loan payments 
. Other Considerations (a strong candidate will think of these): potential decline in popularity of yoga, marketing promotions, etc. 
Information on Cost (provide when asked) 
. No variable costs on a per-customer basis - all costs are fixed. 
. 5 main fixed costs: Rent/utilities building = $3500 a month; Liability Insurance = $1800 a year; administration costs (including owner 
salary, supplies, computer system, marketing supplies) = $800 a week; Yoga instructor salaries: $50 a class; Loan Payments (to pay 
off major paint/floor/plumbing renovations) = $500 a month 
Information on Revenue (provide when asked) 
. Class fees are Orange Yoga¡¯s only source of revenue 
. All classes cost $12 and there are average of 8 students per class on weekdays and 6 students per class on weekends 
. Assume every month has 22 weekdays and 8 weekend days 
351

Orange Yoga Studio 
Analysis Continued 
Answers: 
Revenue: ($12 per class * 5 classes per day *8 students per class * 22 weekdays in a month) = $10,560 a month on weekdays 
($12 per class*4 classes per day*6 students per class * 8 weekend days in a month) = $2304 a month on weekends 
Total Revenue per month = $12,864 (can be rounded to $12.8K) 
Costs: Monthly costs = $3500 in rent per month+150 in insurance per month ($1800/12) + $3200 in admin costs per month 
($1000*4) + $5500 in yoga teacher salaries on weekdays ($50 a class * 5 classes a day *22 weekdays a month) + $1600 in yoga 
teacher salaries on weekends ($50 a class*4 classes a day*8 weekend days a month) + $500 a month in loan payments. 
Total Costs per month = $14,450 (can be rounded to $14.5K) 
After being provided information on cost and revenue, the candidate should realize that Yoga Jones currently is losing approximately 
$1.7K ($1650) a month in profit. 
352

Orange Yoga Studio 
Prompt #2: Brainstorm 
(Note: A strong candidate will naturally begin to go into the ¡°So What¡± after analyzing the profit scenario, and begin to hypothesize on 
the potential ways to improve revenue or lower costs. Steer the conversation by using the following prompt) 
Prompt: ¡°After analyzing her books, Yoga Jones realizes that her decline in profit began after a $2000 per month rent increase last year 
and a decision to raise all teacher salaries by $10 per class. She does not want to move and believes strongly in paying her teachers a 
high wage for their work. 
What else can she do?¡± 
Analysis 
Potential solutions 
Revenue: 
. Charge more for classes 
. Variable pricing: charge more for certain clients or for certain classes 
. Diversify products: Offer higher-priced classes, like pilates; start offering private classes or teacher-training classes; or start selling 
related products, like yoga mats or water bottles 
. Offer more classes 
. Get more clients 
Cost: 
. Eliminate unprofitable classes, cut down on her own salary, etc.. 
. (Not a great idea: refinancing loans¡ªher loan payments are relatively small) 
After the candidate has run out of ideas, show them Exhibit #1 and ask: ¡°Yoga Jones feels that she may not be meeting her students 
demands with class times and this could be creating problems. Here is some information that may help.¡±

Analysis 
Chart insights: The presentation of information on the four graphs is deliberately overwhelming. All candidates should realize that the 
top two graphs both pertain to weekday trends and the bottom two graphs pertain to weekend trends; strong candidates will structure 
their analysis separately for weekends and weekdays. No detailed calculations are necessary for this graph - just insights 
Key Weekday Insights: 
. Midday classes have a lower number of students than morning and evening classes 
. This trend has become more pronounced over last 5 years 
. Strong candidates will note that the 10am classes are not generating enough revenue to even cover teacher salary 
Key Weekend Insights 
. Has opposite profile of weekday classes: midday classes are much more popular than evening classes 
. This trend has remained somewhat steady over past 5 years, though has become slightly more pronounced 
. Strong candidates will note that evening classes are not generating enough revenue to even cover teacher salary 
A strong candidate will also notice that the max number of average participants peaks at 10 for both weekday and weekend classes 
Strong candidates will also begin to hypothesize potential solutions, including restructuring class times to better meet the needs of 
clients, eliminating unprofitable classes, and perhaps adding additional classes/instructors in the evening 
356

Orange Yoga Studio 
Prompt #3: Increase Class Size 
(Note: A strong candidate will notice that the max number of average participants peaks at 10 for both weekday and weekend classes. 
If they do not realize this, steer them towards this realization). 
Prompt: ¡°Good point. Yoga Jones currently allows a max of 10 students per class in order to keep the classes small. However, upon 
looking at her registration records, it appears that she is almost always turning away students for her weekday evening classes and 
weekend morning classes. 
She would like to see if she can fit more students in her studio. Her studio is 13ft long and 21 ft wide. The average yoga mat is 6 ft long 
and 2 ft wide. Yoga Jones feels that the minimum distance between 2 mats should be one foot, and the minimum distance between a 
mat and a wall should be 6 inches. How many mats can she fit in her studio?¡± 
Analysis 
Potential solution: See chart at left. She can fit up to 13 mats in her 
studio. Candidates can solve this either drawing it out (at left) or 
realizing that each mat will need a total of 21 square feet (6 inches on 
each side) and the studio is 273 square feet. 273/21=13 
(The instructor does not need a mat) 
21 ft 
13 ft 
357

Orange Yoga Studio 
Prompt #4: Implementation 
Prompt: If Yoga Jones eliminates all of her classes that currently do not cover teacher salary and begins allowing 13 students into each 
class, will this be enough to save her studio? 
Assume all current classes that currently have 10 students always have a waiting list of at least 3 students 
Analysis 
Cost 
. Yoga Jones will eliminate 1 weekday class (10 am) and 2 weekend classes (6pm and 8pm). Instructor salaries will change, all other 
costs will remain the same: 
. Rent/utilities building = $3500 a month; Liability Insurance = $1800 a year; administration costs (including owner salary, supplies, 
computer system, marketing supplies) = $800 a week; Yoga instructor salaries: $50 a class; Loan Payments (to pay off major 
paint/floor/plumbing renovations) = $500 a month 
. Monthly Total = 3500 (rent) + 150 (insurance) + 3200 (admin) + $500 (loans) + $800 (weekend teacher salary) + $4400 (weekday 
teacher salary = $12,500 
Revenue 
. New weekday schedule: 3 classes with 13 students each; 1 class with 5 students = 44 students per day *$12*22= $11,616 
. New weekend schedule: 2 classes with 13 students each= 26 students per day *$12*8 = $2,496 
Profit: $1612 (ok to round to $1.6k) 
Strong candidate may also want to try to explore adding additional evening classes to increase revenue. 
358

Orange Yoga Studio 
Recommendation 
What are your final recommendations to Yoga Jones? 
Analysis 
All candidates should summarize their analysis and recommend increasing the max class size to 13 and eliminating classes. 
Strong candidates will briefly summarize their analysis and results, but focus primarily on risks and next steps (emphasizing growth). 
Risks include: losing long-term clients who valued flexible class times, upsetting clients who enjoyed small class sizes, and upsetting 
valued teachers whose classes were eliminated. 
Next step include: Mitigating against risks mentioned above - but more importantly, exploring some of the other options that were 
outside of the scope of this case, including raising prices, diversifying products, etc¡­

Coyotes 
Prompt #1 
Your client is the American Southwest Preservation Trust (ASPT). The trust is a non-profit organization tasked with promoting 
conservation & eco-tourism in the American Southwest. One of the biggest tourist draws is local fauna, particularly coyotes. The 
coyote population has declined significantly from historical levels. The Trust requests your help to figure out why & what it should do. 
Case Guidance 
This case is geared towards challenging brainstorming and frameworking skills, while at the same time honing public math and 
analytical skills. It simulates cases which have uncommon or unanticipated structural elements, and may be especially appropriate for 
individuals who need practice building creative frameworks. 
Interviewer Guidance ¨C Prompt Q&A 
Provide the additional information if requested: 
. Coyotes are medium size canine carnivores (between a fox and a wolf) native to the American Southwest. 
. Coyote populations were historically stable until recently. Only 10,000 coyotes exist today down from 25,000. 
. Geographically, only consider the area administered by the trust. 
. No other fauna or flora have been impacted as much.

- Environmental factors (pollution, climate change, species migration) 
- Dietary factors (number of predators, number of prey, availability of water) 
- Human-generated factors (hunting, poaching, habitat loss) 
- Disease and Genetics 
Award brownie points for additional creative ideas. 
Steer the candidate gradually towards human-generated factors (habitat loss and hunting). Have the candidate brainstorm for a few 
minutes how habitat loss would impact the species, especially given that other factors haven¡¯t changed significantly with time (prey 
availability, water, hunting, etc). 
A strong candidate may immediately guess changing birth rates, fertility, and the availability of finding partners. Regardless of whether 
the candidate gets to this or not, steer the candidate by issuing the next prompt (below). 
Prompt #2 ¨C For Analysis 
The client is likewise concerned by the impact of development and interactions with man on the coyote population, and wants to 
understand the expected impact on the population this year. ASPT has provided a few demographic details they have on the coyote 
population in the area (Exhibits A and B).

Exhibit A: Habitat Loss 
The coyote population is currently split into three groups (shown by silver clouds) following the construction of highways (black 
lines) and cities (yellow dots).

Coyotes 
Analysis Part 1 ¨C Solution 
The candidate should arrive at the following numbers (series of multiplications) needed for the second part. 
Interviewer Guidance: Exhibits and Analysis Part 1 
From the exhibits, the candidates should point out links between groups, unequal gender sizes, and different numbers of hunting 
licenses for similarly sized territories. 
The candidate should grasp that the overall goal of the analysis is to find out how populations are changing. The first step is finding out 
the current number of coyotes in each group by gender. 
The total population should have been asked for during the Q&A portion. If the candidate did not get to it then, provide the number 
now (10,000). 
The first step is to break out the 10k by each group by gender. If the candidate doesn¡¯t think of this, steer them towards it. Some 
candidates may try to jump towards calculating births and deaths, in which case they guessed the missing steps (see next section), but 
have them work out the calculations by gender and group first.

Coyotes 
Interviewer Guidance: Analysis Part 2 
Let the candidate drive the continuation of the analysis. If the candidate is lost, ask them how they would calculate the change in 
coyotes every year. The general equation they should arrive at: 
Change in coyotes for this year = Number Born in this year ¨C Number Died in this year. Focus them on calculating the change for this 
year! 
Several pieces of information have been deliberately withheld from the candidate. A perceptive candidate will ask for them: 
. Litter size: This is the number of coyotes born to each pregnant female. Assume 2 pups/litter. 
. Gestation period: Assume coyotes breed once per year. 
. Partner fidelity: Assume that coyotes are monogamous (meaning that once a male coyote has impregnated one female coyote, he 
will not impregnate another female coyote). 
. Availability or % Mate: Not all coyotes will breed each year. Assume that only 40% of potential pairs birth a litter each year. 
. The candidate should notice that hunting isn¡¯t the only cause of death. Assume that all other deaths are natural and the death rate 
is 10% (applies to adults only ¨C use beginning population and don¡¯t include pups). 
. Assume that hunting deaths happen at the end of the year, and hence so is cumulative with the natural deaths. 
Other questions that the candidate could ask: 
. What are the frequency of hunting licenses? Answer: annual 
. How many coyotes does a license permit to be killed? Answer: one 
. Can both males and females be hunted? Answer: yes 
. Do all hunting licenses get used? Answer: assume yes 
Lastly, because of the monogamous nature of coyotes, the candidate should pick up on the fact that the lesser occurring gender in 
each territory is the limiting factor on births. 
366

Analysis Part 2 ¨C Solution 
The candidate should arrive at the following numbers. 
The equations for getting them are: 
# of Births: # of Pairs * % Mate * Birth Rate 
# of Deaths: (Beginning Population ¨C Hunting Deaths) * Natural Death Rate 
Note that calculating Deaths as ¡°(Beginning Population * Natural Death Rate) + Hunting Deaths¡± wrongfully assumes that none 
of the hunted coyotes would have died naturally if they had not been hunted

B 560 380 180 
C 320 760 -440 
Total 2,160 2,260 -100 
Advanced Conclusions from Analysis 
A very perceptive candidate should notice: 
. The decline is gradual (only 100 coyotes per year). Hence the historical number of 25k must either imply a long time ago or a large 
drop due to other circumstances. 
. The C population group will be gone in approximately 10 years, or even sooner if females are hunted or die disproportionately. 
. The other groups should grow if hunting and natural deaths affect both genders equally and at present rates. 
. Overall, coyotes are likely to remain in the Southwest. 
368

Coyotes 
Prompt #3 (if time) 
ASPT is considering lobbying for a reduction in hunting licenses. How would you design a proposed reduction, and what information 
would you use to support it? 
Interviewer Guidance: 
The candidate should hopefully mention some of the bullet points under the advanced analysis section if they have gotten to this 
point. If not, spend some time with the analysis results and ask the candidate what they imply. 
Afterwards, redirect the candidate towards the topic of hunting licenses. Ask if hunting licenses are really the issue. If after the 
candidate struggles for a few minutes, they are still lost, point out that more hunting licenses were issued for Group A rather than C, 
even though the groups were the same size. 
This should mean that Group A should not be sustainable, while Group C should be growing. However, the reality is exactly the 
opposite. Ask the candidate why? 
The candidate should quickly zero in on two potential culprits: 
. The gender ratio in Group A v. Group C 
. The percentage that mate 
Since the percentage that mate (and other factors) are constant, the gender ratio must be the key. Once the candidate realizes this, 
proceed to the recommendation portion of the case. 
369

Coyotes 
Recommendation 
Recommendations should include: 
. Overall, the population of coyotes is not at risk. 
o One group of coyotes (Group C) will die out within 10 years, if no interventions are attempted. 
. ASPT can help rescue or foster coyote population growth by: 
o Evening out the gender ratio between populations by building wildlife bridges, transplanting coyotes, etc. 
o Helping coyotes locate each other and increasing the mating pair percentage. 
o Increasing fertility levels (# of pups/pair) using medical techniques. 
. (For those who made it to Prompt #3) The ASPT should not invest significant resources in a legislative battle against hunting licenses 
if licenses are maintained at the current levels. 
o That said, a temporary hunting ban in Group C would likely help as an effort is made to stabilize the female population

The Everything Retailer 
Prompt 
A mass retailer Everything Retailer is seeing stagnating growth in its year-over-year sales. You were brought in to identify the issue and 
propose ways to boost sales growth. 
Interviewer Guidance 
This starts as a broad case on strategy ¨C there are many different ways the interviewee may want to proceed. Quantitative analysis 
begins when the interviewee identifies the need for a new store format. Bonus points if, at the end, the interviewee mentions other 
risks and ways to mitigate them. 
Additional information: 
. Large US retailer (think Walmart) with an extensive network of big-box discount stores across the US. 
. Sales growth slowed to 1-2%, while industry is growing at 3%. Client¡¯s target: double-digit ¡°comp sales¡± growth. 
. If asked about any increases in costs, say no. This is irrelevant. 
372

The Everything Retailer 
Analysis 
1) Ask the interviewee to identify the source of Everything Retailer¡¯s problem by presenting data on sales from Everything Retailer 
. Show Exhibit 1 
Recommendation 
Some potential sources of flat growth that the interviewee may mention are: 
. New competitors, especially e-commerce as consumers shift away from big-box stores to shopping online ¨C tell him/her that this is 
an interesting additional consideration, but steer him/her away from delving into this. 
. Big-box stores¡¯ product assortment ¨C no longer as relevant to the customers shopping in those stores. 
. Macroeconomic factors ¨C recession and decrease in consumers¡¯ disposable income. 
Exhibit 1 shows that stores are now opening faster than the sales are increasing. Thus, the current store format has reached its 
maximum penetration, and sales are flat. 
. Need to tap into a new customer segment.

Purple Pill Company 
Prompt 
Your client is a multinational pharmaceutical and biologics company. The client has a portfolio of drugs for major disease areas, 
including cancer, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal diseases, to name a few. The client has experienced a decline in revenue over the 
last 18 months, and is fearful of further declines, especially given that its most commercially successful drug, which treats acid reflux 
disease, will be going off of patent in May of next year. What are the areas they should look into to change the course of this trend? 
Interviewer Guidance 
The candidate should come up with a MECE framework that covers the following areas: product mix, industry trends, competitors 
. The candidate should identify that this is a revenue problem, given the prompt. 
. A good candidate will identify the patent expiration impact on revenues quickly. 
. A good candidate may also discuss sales by region (since it is a global company) in addition to product mix. 
. Additional information should be provided upon request: 
o Exhibit 1 Revenues by disease area (Product Mix)

Analysis 
What are the largest drivers of revenue decline over the last year? (Provide Exhibit 1 if not already provided) 
Guidance: 
. Give the candidate 20-30 seconds to review the chart. Then, prompt them to start sharing insights. 
o E.g. - Overall business is declining ~10%, driven by neuroscience, and cardiovascular & oncology 
o E.g. - Respiratory is driving growth, driven by the blue pill; has also gained market share 
. Ask: Which drug is largest source of dollar declines from 2013 to 2012? How much is the loss? 
. Math: 
o Red Pill: 22% x $21B = $4.6B / .92 = $5B .. 4.6B ¨C 5.0B = $0.4B, or $400M loss 
o Purple Pill: 15% x $21B = $3.15B / .98 = $3.21B .. 3.21-3.15= $0.06B, or $60M loss 
o Green Pill: 7% x $21B = $1.5B/ .6 = $2.5B .. 2.5B ¨C 1.5B =$1B loss 
Recommendation 
. Brainstorming ¨C Ask candidate: What are some issues that could have caused this decline? 
o Acceptable answers: lower price, lower tablet sales volume, generics coming on market, regulatory restrictions, out of 
stocks, currency and geographic trends 
o Good candidates will connect generics coming on market to reduced market share in Exhibit 1. 
. Additional information to be provided as confirmation: 
. In addition to other issues, the decline is attributed to the introduction of generics in the US and other established markets. It¡¯s fair 
to attribute 50% of the decline to generics. The additional declines were related to Medicaid liability and other inventory related 
issues. 
Purple Pill Company

Purple Pill Company 
Analysis 
Given these issues with the Green Pill, the client would like your help in determining specifically how to maintain as much revenue 
as possible from the Purple Pill when it goes off patent next year. It has several options that it would like for you to evaluate. 
Options: 
1. Do nothing 
2. License the brand to an over the counter (OTC) manufacturer for $250M one-time revenue 
3. Direct-to-patient campaign online and pay 3rd party for delivery 
Additional facts and assumptions: 
. With no action, Green Pill lost 20% of annual volume in the past (use this assumption) 
. Current revenue per pill is $1 at an 80% margin ¨C (remember, total revenue $3.2B) 
. 10% of current Purple Pill volume will transfer to OTC brand ¨C we get only one time revenue 
. Direct to patient will retain 25% that would¡¯ve been lost to generic but the margin would be reduced to 50% 
. Over 2/3 of the Purple Pill¡¯s revenue comes from the US. 
Recommendation 
Ask: What would you do and why? What are your assumptions on incremental or retained volume in each scenario? Why? 
The head of Purple Pill brand needs to make a decision would like for us to share our recommendation today. Please share your 
analysis and recommendation. 
383

Purple Pill Company 
Analysis 
Decision 
Math: 
. Do nothing: $3.2B x .80 retained (20% lost) = $2.5B revenue x 80% margin = $2B gross profit 
. License for $250M = $2B + $250M = $2.25B ¨C (10% x $3.2B x 80%) = $2.25B - $0.256B = -$60K 
. Direct to patient program - Do nothing = $2B + (20% lost x 25% of this retained x $3.2B x 50% margin) = $2B + $.08B = $2.08B 
Guidance: 
The math is important here, but more important is that the candidate can think through short-term and long term scenarios. For 
example, licensing may look like breakeven in year one and retain the brand, but it is a long-term loss as there is no additional revenue 
(the $250B) in year 2. You would want there to be little to no cannibalization. 
Also, if the direct to patient program cannibalizes more of your existing 80% margin business, you will lose money if you don¡¯t increase 
the price. 
This case gauges the candidates comfort with making assumptions and making strategic decisions.
